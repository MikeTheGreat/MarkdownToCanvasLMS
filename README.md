# markdown-to-canvas

Sync a Markdown course repository to [Canvas LMS](https://www.instructure.com/canvas).

Write your course content as Markdown files in a local folder. Run this tool to convert them to HTML and publish them to Canvas — pages, assignments, discussion topics, and modules.

## Project Vision

Way back when I used to publish all my course materials using a website.  It was great!  I could use a WYSIWIG HTML editor as "Word, but for the web" and then I could use an FTP client to upload everything I'd done.  The FTP client overwrote stuff on the webserver only if the local file was newer so I could just tell it to "upload everything" and know that a couple minutes later all my changes would be there.  

Contrast that with the Canvas LMS web UI, which still doesn't have a search feature here in late 2026, but does feature a 3-10 second load time for every page you want to look at (and another 3-10 seconds to open the "Edit this page" page) assuming you even remember where you need to make changes.

Having the "real" copy of my course as a folder of local files was great.  Want to make a quick change to your class, during class, on the fly?  Change it, tell FileZilla to upload it, and it'll be done inside of 2 minutes.  Want to fix a typo somewhere that you just noticed?  Fix it, forget it, and rest easy knowing that the next time you upload everything that "teh" will become "the".  Want to search everything in your course?  No problem - the entire course is right here.  Want to make changes to a bunch of assignments ("Here's my brand-shiny-new AI policy:...")?  It's quick and easy!  So is "find and replace"! It was super easy, barely an inconvenience!

This tool, markdown-to-canvas, attempts to replicate that experience.

### Goals and Benefits

* **Your local files are the source of truth for your course**  
  * Stuff in Canvas gets overwritten by your local files, but only if your changes are newer
  * You can add stuff to Canvas that's not in your local files and this tool ignores it.  E.g., you can post an Announcement directly in Canvas and this tool won't touch it.
  * Your local files serve as a backup for the next time [Canvas goes down](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5580312/aws-outage) or [Canvas gets hacked.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Canvas_data_breach).

- **You can store your entire course here**
  * Assignments, Pages, Modules, Quizzes, the syllabus, that thumbnail that gets displayed on the course dashboard, your grading schema, due dates, everything

* **You can track your courses using a source control system**
* **There's a single "update" command the uploads everything that's changed**
  * I can edit a whole bunch of different files for a given unit of instruction, run the update command, and not have to worry that I remembered to upload everything I changed.
* **Markdown is "good enough"**
  * There's enough structure to make documents readable (headings, lists, links) but it's limited enough that you won't get derailed trying to do something fiddly with HTML + CSS.
  * Because it's pretty simple, the resulting HTML is surprisingly accessible.
* **You can diff courses against each other**
* **The tool is a CLI not a GUI**
  * It's easy for computer geeks to use and could be incorporated into larger scripts or whatnot

**Note**: except for this "Project Vision" section pretty much the entire rest of this file is AI written.  It's meant to be a guide for using the tool (how to install, command line arguments, file formats, etc)

## Important Gotch'yas

* If you change a Module Markdown file then all the links in that module will be invalidated.  

* If you want to move or rename a file please use the `mv` subcommand - it'l adjust links, the manifest cache, etc, for you.

## How it works

```
course-repo/
├── pages/                  ← subfolders OK (flattened to Canvas)
│   ├── syllabus.md
│   └── week1/
│       └── notes.md
├── assignments/            ← subfolders OK

└── assets/
    └── images/
        └── diagram.png
```

On each run the tool:

1. Applies `course_settings.toml` (name, dates, grading standards, assignment groups, policies)
2. Uploads `course_settings/syllabus.md` as the course syllabus body
3. Uploads everything in `assets/` to Canvas Files
4. Converts each `.md` in `pages/`, `assignments/`, `discussions/`, `announcements/` (including subfolders) to HTML via Pandoc and uploads
5. Syncs `quizzes/` (Classic Quizzes API); `question_banks/` is validated but not uploaded (see [Question banks](#question-banks-question_banks))
6. Rewrites cross-links between files to correct Canvas URLs
7. Syncs `modules/` last (after all content has Canvas IDs)

Files are skipped if their local modification time is older than the `last_synced` timestamp in the manifest — so unchanged files cost nothing on repeat runs.

Files matched by an optional `.canvasignore` (git's `gitignore` syntax) at the repo root are never uploaded — handy for excluding editor backups and temp files such as Word's `~$*.docx`. `.gitignore` is **not** consulted, so you can keep per-term materials out of git while still uploading them to Canvas. To exclude content from both git and Canvas, list it in both files.

A manifest file named after the `canvas.toml` in use (`course_settings/canvas.toml` → `.manifest-canvas.toml`) is written to your course repo to track Canvas IDs and sync times. It is local to your machine and must never be committed (`import`'s default `.gitignore` excludes it). Each machine that holds a manifest also runs `upgrade` when the repo's file format changes (see [Upgrading a repo](#upgrading-a-repo-upgrade)).

## Installation

### Requirements

* Python 3.11+
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for install/run)
* Pandoc — either install it system-wide **or** run `markdown-to-canvas setup` after installing the tool (see below)
* A Canvas LMS account with API access

### Recommended: install as a `uv` tool

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/MikeTheGreat/MarkdownToCanvasLMS
```

Then run from anywhere:

```bash
markdown-to-canvas ./my-course
```

### Run without installing (one-off)

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/MikeTheGreat/MarkdownToCanvasLMS markdown-to-canvas \
  ./my-course
```

One-off `uvx` runs require a system-wide Pandoc install — `markdown-to-canvas setup` cannot help here because `uvx` uses a temporary environment that is discarded after the run.

### Install for development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeTheGreat/MarkdownToCanvasLMS
cd MarkdownToCanvasLMS
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

After that, run the CLI directly without activating the venv:

```bash
uv run markdown-to-canvas ./my-course
```

Or activate the venv first and then call the command normally:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
markdown-to-canvas ./my-course
```

Run the tests the same way:

```bash
uv run pytest
# or, with the venv active:
pytest
```

### Installing Pandoc

You have two options:

* **System-wide install** (required for `uvx` one-off runs): install from [pandoc.org](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) or via your package manager (`brew install pandoc`, `apt install pandoc`, etc.).
* **Tool-local install** (after `uv tool install` only): run the `setup` subcommand to download Pandoc into the tool's own environment:

  ```bash
  markdown-to-canvas setup
  ```

  This places the Pandoc binary alongside the tool so no separate system installation is needed. It is a no-op if Pandoc is already found.

---

## Configuration

### `canvas.toml`

Place this file in your course repo's `course_settings/` folder (i.e. `course_settings/canvas.toml`), or pass `--config` to point elsewhere. Commit it — it contains no secrets.

```toml
base_url  = "https://yourschool.instructure.com"
course_id = 12345

[auth]
# Fallback token for local use only. Prefer the CANVAS_API_TOKEN env var.
# Never commit a real token to version control.
api_token = ""

# Optional. Overrides the same-named flags in course_settings.toml for runs
# that use *this* config — see "Several Canvas courses from one repo".
[course_flags]
in_person_class = false
```

### Several Canvas courses from one repo

One course repo can drive more than one Canvas course — a separate section of
the same class, a sandbox copy, a colleague's shell — by keeping one
`canvas.toml` per course and naming it with `--config`:

```
course_settings/
  canvas.toml            # base_url + course_id for the main section
  canvas-sec-a.toml      # same base_url, different course_id
  canvas-sec-b.toml
```

```bash
markdown-to-canvas update . --config course_settings/canvas-sec-a.toml
markdown-to-canvas update . --config course_settings/canvas-sec-b.toml
```

Each config gets its own manifest, named after the config file:
`canvas-sec-a.toml` → `.manifest-canvas-sec-a.toml`. That is what keeps the
runs independent — Canvas IDs and `last_synced` times are per course, so
syncing section B does not make section A look up to date, and a `-t`/`-s`
run against one section never touches the other's IDs. Commit all of them.

`--config` is accepted by `update`, `prune`, `clean-manifest`, and `find-canvas-orphans`. `mv`
has no `--config`: a rename is a repo-wide fact, so it rewrites every
`.manifest-*.toml` it finds in the repo root.

#### Making the sections differ

The content is one repo, so by default every section gets the same pages. To
make a section differ, give its `canvas.toml` a `[course_flags]` table:

```toml
# course_settings/canvas-sec-a.toml
base_url  = "https://yourschool.instructure.com"
course_id = 67890

[course_flags]
in_person_class = false
night_section   = true
```

These merge with the `[course_flags]` table in `course_settings.toml`: a flag
defined in both takes the `canvas.toml` value, and flags defined in only one
file are kept as they are. Everything that reads flags then follows —
`#if`/`#elif` regions in bodies, `published_if` in frontmatter, and `only_if`
on `due_dates` entries — so one repo can give section B different text,
different published items, and different due dates while sharing grading
standards, assignment groups, rubrics and the rest of
`course_settings.toml`. See
[Course flags](#course-flags--conditional-content-if--elif--else--endif).

When a run's `canvas.toml` contributes flags, the tool prints them and says
which ones overrode `course_settings.toml`:

```text
Flags:     in_person_class=false, night_section=true  (from canvas-sec-a.toml)
           overriding course_settings.toml: in_person_class
```

`publish` and `list-titles` take `--config` for this reason too — they read
the file only for its `[course_flags]` table, so no API token (and no
`base_url`/`course_id`) is needed. What still cannot vary per section is
everything else in `course_settings.toml`: course name, grading standards,
assignment groups, late policy, tab configuration. Those are one set of values
per repo.

### Which course a manifest belongs to

The manifest is named after the `canvas.toml` file, not after the course inside
it, so changing `course_id` in `canvas.toml` keeps using the same manifest — and
all of its Canvas IDs still point into the old course. To catch that, the
manifest records the course it belongs to (a `_canvas_course` entry holding
`base_url`, `course_id` and the course name), and `update`, `prune --delete` and
`prune --unpublish` check it after connecting to Canvas.

These commands already print the repo, the course id and base URL, and the
course's name as it comes back from Canvas:

```text
Repo:      /home/you/Courses/my-course
Course ID: 2735395  (https://cascadia.instructure.com)
Course:    IT-CS 142 (2026 Fall)
```

The prompts below come right after those lines, so you can check the course name
before anything is uploaded to it.

- **Same course recorded** — the run continues with no prompt.
- **No course recorded** — you are asked to confirm before it is recorded. This
  covers a first sync (a new manifest) and a manifest written before this check
  existed. In the second case, answer no and run `clean-manifest` first if the
  manifest may have been used with another course.
- **A different course recorded** — the recorded and requested courses are
  printed together and you are asked whether to change. Answering yes clears
  every Canvas ID from the manifest and records the new course, then the run
  continues and re-creates this repo's content in it. Every recorded ID belongs
  to the old course — Canvas IDs are unique per object, so none of them can exist
  in the new one. **If the new course already holds a copy of this content (for
  example it was copied from the old course inside Canvas), this leaves
  duplicates.** Answering no changes nothing, which is what you want if
  `canvas.toml` is simply wrong.

`-y`/`--yes` answers yes to any of these prompts, which is needed when there is
no terminal (a script or CI job). Without a terminal and without `--yes`, the run
stops and changes nothing.

`update --check-all` and `prune --manifest-only` never contact Canvas and do not
check.

### API token

Get your token from Canvas: **Account → Settings → New Access Token**.

Pass it as an environment variable (recommended):

```bash
export CANVAS_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"
markdown-to-canvas ./my-course
```

Or put it in a `.env` file in your working directory (loaded automatically on startup):

```bash
# .env
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Or put it in the `[auth]` block of `course_settings/canvas.toml` for local-only use (add `course_settings/canvas.toml` to `.gitignore` if you do this).

## Usage

```
Usage: markdown-to-canvas update [OPTIONS] [REPO]

  Sync a Markdown course repo to Canvas LMS.

Arguments:
  REPO                            Path to the course content repo. If omitted, the enclosing
                                  repo is found by walking up from the current directory,
                                  so you can run `markdown-to-canvas update` from any
                                  subdirectory.  [optional]

Options:
  --config PATH                   Path to canvas.toml  [default: <repo>/course_settings/canvas.toml]
  --force-uploads                 Re-upload all files even if unchanged since last sync
  --force-overwrite               Skip Canvas timestamp check; always overwrite Canvas
  -t, --target-recursively FILE   Comma-separated files; each is synced plus all resources
                                  it transitively references (BFS). Skips the full sync.
  -s, --single-target FILE        Comma-separated files to sync without traversing references.
                                  Runs after -t. Skips the full sync.
  --check-all                     Dry run: validate the whole repo as if uploading it for the
                                  first time to a brand-new empty Canvas course. Contacts
                                  Canvas for nothing and writes nothing. Exits nonzero if any
                                  problems are found.
  -y, --yes                       Record the course for a manifest that has none
                                  without asking (see "Which course a manifest
                                  belongs to"). Never overrides a different course.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

**Warning**: In order to get changes to the left-hand course navigation column you may need to go
to Settings ➡ Navigation and then click the 'Save' button.

## Canvas overwrite protection

By default, before uploading any item that already exists in Canvas the tool fetches its `updated_at` timestamp from Canvas and compares it to the local file's modification time. If Canvas is newer — meaning someone edited the item directly in Canvas after the last sync — the upload is **skipped**.

At the end of the run, all skipped items are printed together as a single list:

```text
The following resources were NOT uploaded because Canvas has a newer version.
Review these files and re-upload manually if needed (use --force-overwrite to skip this check):
  pages/syllabus.md
  assignments/week2.md
```

This lets you review the diverged items before deciding what to do:

* **Keep the Canvas version** — update your local file to match Canvas, then sync again.
* **Keep the local version** — use `--force-overwrite` to overwrite Canvas regardless:

```bash
markdown-to-canvas update . --force-overwrite
```

`--force-overwrite` skips the Canvas timestamp check entirely. This is also faster (no extra API calls) when you know the local repo is the authoritative source and don't need the protection.

The two flags are independent:

|                                   | `--force-uploads` | `--force-overwrite`   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Bypasses local`mtime` check       | Yes               | No                    |
| Bypasses Canvas timestamp check   | No                | Yes                   |
| Extra Canvas API calls (per item) | Same              | Fewer (check skipped) |

Use both flags together to re-upload and overwrite everything unconditionally.

---

### Full sync (default)

Syncs every file in the course repo. Files that haven't changed since their last `last_synced` manifest timestamp are skipped automatically.

```bash
# canvas.toml lives in the repo's course_settings/ folder (default)
markdown-to-canvas update ./my-course

# explicit config path
markdown-to-canvas update ./my-course --config ~/secrets/canvas.toml

# force re-upload of everything regardless of timestamps
markdown-to-canvas update ./my-course --force-uploads
```

### Typical full-sync workflow

```bash
# 1. Pull latest content
cd my-course && git pull

# 2. Sync to Canvas (only changed files are uploaded)
CANVAS_API_TOKEN=your-token-here \
  markdown-to-canvas update .
```

The manifest (`.manifest-canvas.toml`) that `update` writes is local. Do not
commit it.

---

## Checking a course before deploying (`--check-all`)

`--check-all` runs the entire update pipeline as a **dry run simulating a
first sync to a brand-new, completely empty Canvas course** — every file is
converted, every link resolved, every rubric / assignment-group / due-date
reference checked — but:

* **Canvas is never contacted** (works offline; no API token needed), and
* **nothing is written** (no Canvas changes, no manifest
  changes — the existing manifest is ignored so *everything* gets checked,
  not just files changed since the last sync).

```bash
markdown-to-canvas update ./my-course --check-all
```

Typical use: develop a course repo over a break, run `--check-all`
periodically to catch problems, then deploy the whole course with a plain
`update` when the quarter starts. It exits nonzero when problems are found,
so it also works in scripts and pre-deploy hooks.

Problems it catches include: broken local links/images, rubric names not
defined in `rubrics.toml`, unknown assignment groups, malformed YAML
frontmatter, missing snippets, course-flag/`published_if` errors, `<h1>`
headings, title collisions, quiz/question parse errors, module items pointing
at missing files, `due_dates` entries matching nothing, missing
`annotatable_attachment` files, unused course flags, and `pinned_resources`
entries matching nothing on disk.

What it **cannot** catch: anything only the Canvas server decides — e.g. due
dates rejected for falling outside the term, quizzes needing a manual "Save
It Now", or API permission errors. Those can still surface on the real
deploy.

`--check-all` always checks the whole repo, so it cannot be combined with
`-t`/`-s`; `--force-uploads`/`--force-overwrite` are meaningless here (every
file is already treated as new, and Canvas timestamps are never consulted)
and are rejected too.

---

## Selective sync

Use `-t` or `-s` when you only want to sync part of the course. Both flags skip the full course sync.

### `-t` — recursive (BFS)

Syncs the specified file(s) and every resource they transitively reference, following links depth-first until no new local files are found.

```bash
# Re-sync a module and everything it links to
markdown-to-canvas update . -t modules/week-1.md

# Re-sync two modules and all their dependencies
markdown-to-canvas update . -t modules/week-1.md,modules/week-2.md

# Force re-upload even for unchanged files
markdown-to-canvas update . -t modules/week-1.md --force-uploads
```

**What counts as a reference:**

* Content files (pages, assignments, discussions): all local `<img src>` and `<a href>` targets in the converted HTML
* Module files: all items listed in the module body
* Asset files: no outgoing references (assets are leaf nodes)

**Module ordering:** modules discovered during BFS are synced last, after all the content they reference has been uploaded and has Canvas IDs — the same guarantee as a full sync.

### `-s` — single target (no traversal)

Syncs only the listed file(s), with no recursive traversal. Useful when you know exactly which files changed and don't need their dependencies re-synced.

```bash
# Re-sync one page
markdown-to-canvas update . -s pages/syllabus.md

# Re-sync several specific files
markdown-to-canvas update . -s assignments/week1.md,discussions/week1-intro.md
```

### Combining `-t` and `-s`

`-t` runs first (full BFS). `-s` runs after, independently. If `-t` already uploaded a file and updated its manifest timestamp, `-s` will skip it automatically via the timestamp check — no special coordination needed.

```bash
# Re-sync a module and all its content (via -t),
# then also sync an unrelated page (via -s)
markdown-to-canvas update . \
  -t modules/week-3.md \
  -s pages/office-hours.md
```

---

## Removing content (`prune`)

`update` never deletes anything from Canvas — if you delete or rename a Markdown
file locally, the item it created stays in Canvas and a stale entry remains in the
manifest. Use `prune` to clean those up.

```text
Usage: markdown-to-canvas prune [OPTIONS] REPO

  Delete or unpublish Canvas items whose local source file no longer exists.

Options:
  --config PATH    Path to canvas.toml  [default: <repo>/course_settings/canvas.toml]
  --delete         Delete the orphaned items from Canvas
  --unpublish      Unpublish (set published=False) the orphaned items on Canvas
  --manifest-only  Remove orphaned entries from the local manifest only; never
                   touch Canvas
  -y, --yes        Record the course for a manifest that has none without asking
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```

`prune` looks for **orphans** — manifest entries whose local file is gone — which
covers both deleting a file and renaming one (the old path is orphaned; the new
name syncs as a fresh item on the next `update`).

You must pass exactly one of `--delete`, `--unpublish`, or `--manifest-only`;
there is no default, so the intent is always explicit. Changes are applied
**immediately** — there is no preview or confirmation prompt — so commit your
manifest first if you want an easy way to undo.

```bash
# Delete every orphaned item from Canvas
markdown-to-canvas prune ./my-course --delete

# ...or hide them instead of deleting (where the type supports it)
markdown-to-canvas prune ./my-course --unpublish

# ...or just clear stale manifest entries without touching Canvas
markdown-to-canvas prune ./my-course --manifest-only
```

Pages, assignments, discussions, quizzes, and modules can be either deleted or
unpublished. Files can only be deleted (Canvas files have no published flag).
Question banks and course-level bookkeeping entries (syllabus, course settings,
module order) are skipped with a warning and keep their manifest entry. A failure
on one item is reported but does not stop the rest of the run.

If a `--delete`/`--unpublish` orphan is **already gone** on Canvas (you deleted it
by hand, or a previous run did), that's treated as success and its stale manifest
entry is dropped — so a half-finished cleanup won't keep failing on the same item.

`--manifest-only` is a local-only escape hatch: it drops every orphaned manifest
entry **without contacting Canvas at all** (no API token or course connection
needed). Use it to clear entries the other modes leave behind — items you already
removed from Canvas manually, unsupported types, or in-use protected resources. It
ignores the in-use protection and type rules above because it never changes
anything on Canvas; it only forgets the local bookkeeping.

---

## Checking the manifest against the course (`clean-manifest`)

The manifest trusts its Canvas IDs indefinitely. An ID stops being valid when
`canvas.toml` is pointed at a different course after a sync, when the item is
deleted directly in Canvas, or when an older version of the tool recorded the
wrong type. `update` does not notice: the entry's `last_synced` says it is up to
date, so the item is skipped and every page that links to it keeps linking to the
bad ID. `clean-manifest` finds and removes those entries.

```text
Usage: markdown-to-canvas clean-manifest [OPTIONS] [REPO]

Options:
  --config PATH  Path to canvas.toml  [default: <repo>/course_settings/canvas.toml]
  --apply           Make the changes. Without it, only report what would change.
  --no-canvas-check Do not check Canvas; treat every entry as invalid.
  -y, --yes         With --apply, skip the confirmation when the manifest records
                    a different course.
  --help            Show this message and exit.
```

```bash
# Report only: nothing is changed
markdown-to-canvas clean-manifest

# Remove the bad entries and mark what links to them for re-sync
markdown-to-canvas clean-manifest --apply

# Then upload what was removed
markdown-to-canvas update
```

It lists the course's pages, assignments, discussions, announcements, quizzes,
modules and files once each, then checks every manifest entry:

- **Entries with a Canvas ID** are removed when that ID is not in the course as
  that type. Pages are checked by page ID, not by URL slug, because two courses
  often have pages with the same slug.
- **Wrong type**: a file under `modules/` recorded as anything other than a
  module (and likewise `assets/` → file, `quizzes/` → quiz) is removed.
- **Syllabus**: removed when it was last synced to a different course.
- **Course settings, rubrics and module order** have no ID to check. They are
  removed only when the manifest was demonstrably used with another course (it
  records a different course, or the syllabus was synced to one), so the next
  `update` re-sends all of them.
- Anything else (for example question banks) is listed as not checked.

Removing an entry does not by itself fix the pages that link to it, because
those files are unchanged locally. So every file that links to a removed entry
(found the same way `find-local-orphans` finds links, including links that come
from snippets) is marked for re-sync, and `course_settings.toml`'s `front_page` /
`dashboard_image` sections are marked if they name one. The next `update`
re-renders those files. They are listed in the report because any edits made to
them directly in Canvas will be overwritten.

If listing the course fails, nothing is changed. Canvas itself is only read,
never changed: removed items that still exist in some other course stay there.

After `--apply`, the manifest records the configured course (see "Which course a
manifest belongs to"). If it recorded a different course, you are asked to
confirm the switch first.

`--no-canvas-check` skips every Canvas lookup and treats all entries as invalid.
That is what moving a repo to a different course means, so `update` uses the same
shortcut when you confirm a course change: no recorded ID can exist in the new
course, so there is nothing to look up. Use it directly when you want the
manifest emptied without waiting for the listings.

---

## Moving and renaming files (`mv`)

Use `mv` to move or rename files and directories within your course repo.
It handles all the bookkeeping so nothing breaks on the next `update`:

```text
Usage: markdown-to-canvas mv [OPTIONS] SRC DEST

  Move or rename a file/directory, updating the manifest and all references.

Options:
  -n, --noop     Show what would change without making any modifications.
  -v, --verbose  Print each individual change (moved file, updated link, etc.).
  --help         Show this message and exit.
```

As with the normal `mv` command, if DEST is an existing directory then SRC is
moved *into* it and keeps its own name; otherwise DEST is the new full path.
Writing DEST with a trailing `/` says "this must be an existing directory" —
`gg mv pages/a.md pages/typo/` is an error rather than a silent rename of
`a.md` to a file called `typo`.

`mv` updates:

* The file/directory on disk (via `git mv` when inside a git repo and the
  source is git-tracked; falls back to a plain filesystem move otherwise,
  e.g. for files not yet `git add`ed)
* Every manifest in the repo root (`.manifest-*.toml`) — manifest keys and `canvas_item_ids` in module entries; `mv` has no `--config`, and a rename applies to every course the repo drives
* All Markdown files — relative links and snippet references
* `module_order.toml` — if a module file is renamed
* `course_settings.toml` — `dashboard_image` and `front_page`, if the file they point to is renamed

**Examples:**

```bash
# Rename a page
markdown-to-canvas mv pages/old-name.md pages/new-name.md

# Rename an asset directory (updates all references across the repo)
markdown-to-canvas mv assets/Lecture-Related/Unit-01 assets/lecture-related/unit-01

# Rename a quiz folder (also renames the inner .md to match)
markdown-to-canvas mv quizzes/old-quiz quizzes/new-quiz

# Move a file into an existing directory, keeping its name
# (like normal mv — this lands at pages/summer/week-1.md)
markdown-to-canvas mv pages/week-1.md pages/summer/

# Preview what would change without doing anything
markdown-to-canvas mv --noop pages/old.md pages/new.md
```

**Restrictions:**

* Both source and destination must be within the same course repo
* Cannot move across content-type directories (e.g. `pages/` to `assignments/`)
* The destination's parent directory must already exist — this prevents accidental
  renames of intermediate path components due to typos. To rename multiple levels,
  rename them one at a time.
* The repo root is auto-detected by looking for `course_settings/course_settings.toml`

This command is purely local — it never contacts Canvas. Run `update` afterward
to push the changes.

---

## Finding unreferenced content

Two subcommands answer "what is nothing pointing at?", from opposite sides.
Both are read-only: neither deletes or changes anything.

Both are **non-transitive**. They report only things that nothing at all
references. An image linked from a page that is itself unreferenced is *not*
reported — the image has an inbound link. Run the command again after acting on
its output to find the next layer.

### `find-local-orphans` — the repo

Reads the course repo on disk. No Canvas call, no API token, works offline.

```bash
markdown-to-canvas find-local-orphans path/to/course-repo
```

```text
Note: snippets, modules, course settings, question banks, quizzes and
announcements are never listed here — they are excluded by design (see
README).

Unreferenced local files (3):

  Assets:
    - assets/handouts/2024-syllabus.pdf
    - assets/old-diagram.png
  Pages:
    - pages/draft-week9.md
```

Every run leads with that note, so an empty report is never mistaken for
"everything in the repo is referenced".

**What can be reported:** files under `assets/`, `.md` files in the content
folders (`pages/`, `assignments/`, `discussions/`, …). Quizzes and announcements
are never reported (see below), though both are still scanned for links.

**What is scanned for references:** content files, `modules/`, `snippets/`,
quizzes and their question files, question banks and their question files,
`course_settings/syllabus.md`, and the `front_page`, `dashboard_image` and
`pinned_resources` keys in `course_settings.toml`. Markdown links, raw HTML
`<img src>`/`<a href>`, module item lists, snippet includes, and an
assignment's `annotatable_attachment` all count as references. `due_dates`
entries do not — they match content by title, not by path.

**What is never reported**, by design:

* **Snippets.** A snippet is a library file. "Nothing includes it this term" is
  not a reason to delete it.
* **`modules/` and `course_settings/`.** These are the roots — nothing in a repo
  ever links *to* a module file or the syllabus, so listing them would be noise.
* **Quizzes and announcements.** Nothing links to an announcement, and a quiz is
  usually reached from a module or taken directly in Canvas, so "unreferenced"
  is not a deletion signal for either. Their contents still count: an asset
  used only inside a quiz or announcement is not reported.
* **Question banks.** Quizzes embed their questions directly; there is no "draw
  N from bank X" reference anywhere in the format, so every bank would be
  reported on every run.
* **Anything in `pinned_resources`**, including everything under a pinned
  folder.
* **Anything matched by `.canvasignore`.**

The command errs toward saying nothing rather than saying something wrong. Links
inside an inactive course-flag branch (`#if` that currently evaluates false)
still count as references, so turning a flag off never makes content look
deletable.

**Errors are listed last.** A file that cannot be parsed or converted has its
links left unfollowed, which can make something it uses look unreferenced. Those
files are named at the bottom of the report, after the findings, so they are hard
to miss:

```text
Errors (1) — these files could not be scanned, so the results above may be incomplete:

    - announcements/no-hybrid-participation.md : timed out after 20s - check for nested []s
```

Conversion is capped at 20 seconds per file. Well-formed course content converts
in well under a second; the cap exists because a run of nested square brackets
makes Pandoc backtrack exponentially — roughly 3x per level, so nine levels takes
*minutes* on a file of a few hundred bytes. Runs like that come from Canvas
exports (see [IMSCC import](#imscc-import)); `update` rarely trips over one
because it skips files whose mtime is unchanged, but this command re-converts
everything on every run. If a file times out, collapse the bracket run — the
brackets carry no formatting.

Nothing in the report is automatically safe to delete — it is a list of things
worth *looking at*. Check them by hand before removing anything.

#### `-v` / `--verbose` — showing what refers to what

`-v` adds a second section listing every *referenced* file with the files that
refer to it. It comes first, so the unreferenced list stays at the bottom of the
output where it is easy to find.

```bash
markdown-to-canvas find-local-orphans -v path/to/course-repo
```

```text
Note: snippets, modules, course settings, question banks, quizzes and
announcements are never listed here — they are excluded by design (see
README).

Referenced local files (3):

  Assets:
    - assets/logo.png : pages/home.md
  Pages:
    - pages/home.md : course_settings/course_settings.toml, modules/week1.md
  Quizzes:
    - quizzes/midterm/midterm.md : course_settings/course_settings.toml (pinned_resources)

Unreferenced local files (2):

  Assets:
    - assets/old-diagram.png
  Pages:
    - pages/draft-week9.md
```

Use it to check *why* something is not being reported — a page you expected to
see listed as an orphan will show the file that still links to it.

The two sections together cover exactly the same set of files: everything that
could be reported as an orphan is in one list or the other. Snippets, modules,
course settings and question banks are in neither, since they can never be
reported (see above). A pin shows up as a referrer labelled
`(pinned_resources)`, since a pin is what is keeping that file off the orphan
list.

### `find-canvas-orphans` — the live course

Queries Canvas and reports resources in the live course that nothing else in
the course references.

```bash
markdown-to-canvas find-canvas-orphans path/to/course-repo
```

It scans page, assignment, discussion, and quiz HTML for internal Canvas links,
follows module item membership, and checks the front page and syllabus.
Resources with zero inbound references are reported with their publish state and
a link.

Use this one to find leftovers from before the repo existed, or content someone
added through the Canvas web UI. Use `find-local-orphans` for the repo you
actually edit.

---

## Content file format

Content files (`pages/`, `assignments/`, `discussions/`, `modules/`, quizzes, and
questions) use **YAML frontmatter** followed by a **Markdown body**. Course-level
settings live in `course_settings.toml` and use **TOML**.

> **Subfolder support:** `pages/`, `assignments/`, and `discussions/` can contain
> arbitrarily nested subfolders for local organisation. Canvas uses a flat namespace,
> so the tool flattens everything on upload. If two files within the same content
> type share the same title (from frontmatter, or filename if no title is set), the
> tool will print an error and abort — rename one of them or give them different
> `title:` values. Module and quiz directories remain flat.

Every example below lists **all available options** with an inline comment for each.
To create a new file, copy the whole block and then delete, edit, or replace the
options you don't want. **Every field is optional** unless a comment says otherwise —
omitted fields are simply left unchanged in Canvas (and `title` falls back to the
filename). All dates are ISO 8601 strings; include a timezone offset (e.g. `-08:00`)
to avoid surprises.

> **Tip — commenting out content:** to exclude content from Canvas — temporarily,
> or per course offering — use **course flags**: wrap the region in
> `<!-- #if flag -->` … `<!-- #endif -->` with a flag defined in
> `course_settings.toml`. This works everywhere, including the structured lists
> the tool parses itself: quiz question links, module items, and question
> `## Answers` entries inside a false branch are skipped (not uploaded, not
> published). See
> [Course flags — conditional content](#course-flags--conditional-content-if--elif--else--endif).
>
> Relatedly, regular fenced code blocks are always literal: links, headings,
> and snippet references (`$path.md$`) inside ```` ``` ```` fences are shown
> as-is, never expanded or treated as quiz questions / module items.

### `course_settings.toml`

Placed inside the `course_settings/` folder (i.e. `course_settings/course_settings.toml`).
Drives the course's own settings: identity, dates, visibility, grading scheme,
assignment groups, and policies. Applied before any content is uploaded.

Edits to this file are change-detected **per section**: only the parts whose
values actually changed are re-sent to Canvas. Flipping a `[course_flags]`
value, editing one `due_dates` entry, or adding a comment does *not* re-send
course metadata, re-upload the dashboard image, or touch the other sections.
(Conversely, editing the `dashboard_image` file itself — without touching the
TOML — *does* re-upload it.)

> **Commented-out settings after an `import`.** A Canvas cartridge carries more
> course settings than this tool uploads. `import` records all of them, but
> writes anything it will not send to Canvas as **comments**, in two labelled
> groups near the top of the file:
>
> ```toml
> # Website title used by `publish`. Not uploaded to Canvas; it exists
> # because `title` below is commented out.
> title_for_publish_to_website = "Intermediate Programming"
>
> # --- Optional overrides; uncomment to replace what your school set ---
> # title = "IT-CS142 OL1 6563 - SU26 - Intermediate Programming"
> # course_code = "IT-CS142 OL1 6563"
>
> # --- Usually admin-only; uncomment only if your Canvas role may set them ---
> # Canvas reserves these to admins at many schools. If your account isn't
> # allowed to change one, Canvas rejects it and `update` reports which.
> # start_at = "2026-04-06T07:00:00"
> # conclude_at = "2026-08-27T07:00:00"
> # is_public = false
>
> # --- Import-only settings, kept for round-trip fidelity ---
> # Read-only in Canvas; these cannot be changed.
> # last_modified = "2025-08-01"
> # root_account_uuid = "BhFU8G3kLiIaPccavNtu4PL9qD7pMpewi1WBKZvh"
> #
> # Not uploaded by markdown-to-canvas; editing these has no effect.
> # storage_quota = 524288000
> # show_total_grade_as_points = false
> ```
>
> The three groups behave differently:
>
> * **Optional overrides** (`title`, `course_code`) *are* uploaded if you
>   uncomment them. Schools normally populate these per section, and their
>   values carry the section number and term, so `import` leaves them commented
>   so a sync cannot overwrite that. Uncomment only if you want this tool to own
>   the field.
> * **Usually admin-only** (`start_at`, `conclude_at`,
>   `restrict_enrollments_to_course_dates`, `is_public`,
>   `is_public_to_auth_users`, `open_enrollment`, `self_enrollment`,
>   `usage_rights_required`) are also uploaded if you uncomment them, but Canvas
>   often reserves them to admins — see "Settings your Canvas account isn't
>   allowed to change" above. Uncomment one only if your role can set it.
> * **Import-only settings** do nothing when uncommented — they are ignored on
>   upload. Some of them are settings Canvas would probably accept; they are
>   unimplemented rather than impossible. See `TODO.md`.
>
> `title_for_publish_to_website` sits above both groups and is **live but
> Canvas-free**: `publish` uses it for the website's title, and nothing ever
> uploads it, so editing it cannot affect the course. `import` seeds it with the
> cartridge's course name. `publish` resolves its title as `title` →
> `title_for_publish_to_website` → `name` → `course_code` → the repo folder
> name, so uncommenting `title` overrides it.
>
> Re-running `import` over an existing repo rewrites the file, so edits to these
> commented lines are not preserved.

> **Settings your Canvas account isn't allowed to change.** Canvas restricts
> some course fields to admins — which ones depends on how your school
> configured the teacher role. Common examples are the visibility flags
> (`is_public`, `is_public_to_auth_users`), the course dates (`start_at`,
> `conclude_at`, `restrict_enrollments_to_course_dates`), and the enrollment
> flags (`open_enrollment`, `self_enrollment`). Canvas rejects the whole update
> if it contains even one of them, without saying which, so `update` retries the
> fields one at a time: everything you *are* allowed to set still gets applied,
> and the run warns with the exact list it was refused, e.g.
>
> ```
>   WARNING: Canvas refused these course_settings fields (is_public, start_at) —
>   your Canvas account lacks permission to change them on this course. …
> ```
>
> Comment those keys out of `course_settings.toml` to silence the warning, or
> ask a Canvas admin to set them (or to grant your role the permission).

`id` and `label` are interchangeable, and matching is **case-insensitive** — just
type the name shown in the sidebar. That name resolves to a built-in tab id first
(`announcements`, `assignments`, `chat`, `collaborations`, `conferences`,
`discussions`, `files`, `grades`, `groups`, `modules`, `outcomes`, `pages`,
`people`, `quizzes`, `syllabus`, `home`, `settings`), and otherwise to any tab's
display label — which is how external tools (Zoom, Panopto, etc.) and renamed
built-ins (e.g. Conferences shown as "BigBlueButton") are matched. `home` and
`settings` are always shown and can't be moved or hidden. Only reordering and
hiding are supported — tabs can't be created here; any entry that doesn't match a
tab already in the course is skipped with a warning.

#### Centralized due dates

The `due_dates` array lets you manage `unlock_at`, `due_at`, and `lock_at` for
all assignments, discussions, and quizzes in one place. Each entry names a
content item by its `title` (from frontmatter); an optional `type` field
(`assignment`, `discussion`, or `quiz`) disambiguates if two items share a
title. Centralized dates override any dates set in frontmatter.

Each date field (`unlock_at`, `due_at`, `lock_at`) accepts either a date string
or one of these sentinel values (case-insensitive):

| Value | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `"2025-02-01T23:59:00"` | Set this date on Canvas |
| `"NONE"` | Actively **clear** this date on Canvas |
| `"KEEP"` | Never send this field, whether the item is new or already exists. A brand-new item gets whatever Canvas defaults to (or whatever the frontmatter sets) |
| `""` (empty string) | Same as `KEEP`, but prints a warning suggesting you use an explicit value |
| `"CREATE_NONE_THEN_KEEP"` | Clear the date when the item is first created on Canvas; on every later update, act as `KEEP` |
| `"NONE"` | Clear the date on every update, not just on create |

`KEEP` and `CREATE_NONE_THEN_KEEP` behave identically for an item that already
exists on Canvas. They differ only on the first upload of a new item.
`CREATE_NONE_THEN_KEEP` is useful for `lock_at` — it clears any lock date
imported from a previous term when the assignment is first created, but leaves
it alone if you later set one by hand in Canvas.

If Canvas rejects the due dates (e.g. `due_at` falls outside existing
`unlock_at`/`lock_at` availability dates), the tool retries the upload without
date fields and prints a warning. The content is still synced; only the dates
are skipped.

Every `update` checks the `due_dates` table against Canvas, but each item's
last-applied dates are cached in the manifest, so **only entries you actually
changed produce API calls** — editing one due date out of dozens updates one
item. (The first run after upgrading to a version with this cache seeds it by
applying every entry once.) A rejected date is deliberately *not* cached: it is
retried, and re-warned about, on every run until you fix it.

**Deleting** a `due_dates` entry does not clear anything on Canvas — it means
"stop managing this item's dates here". The run after the deletion prints a
one-time notice (`NOTICE: due_dates entry for "…" was removed — leaving Canvas
dates as-is`) so the change is visible.

During `update`, the tool prints warnings for:

* A `due_dates` entry whose `name` doesn't match any content file (typo or
  stale entry).
* An assignment, discussion, or quiz that has **no** corresponding `due_dates`
  entry (so you know what's not yet tracked centrally).

Use [`list-titles`](#listing-content-titles-list-titles) to see all available
titles and their current due dates.

If you plan the term as offsets ("due four class days after the start of the
quarter, locks a week later") rather than as calendar dates, the
[`generate-due-dates`](#generating-due-dates-from-offsets-generate-due-dates)
command computes this table from a relative schedule at the start of each term.
After that you edit `due_dates` by hand as usual.

#### Pinned resources (`pinned_resources`)

Re-syncing a quiz **deletes and re-creates every question**, which disconnects
existing student submissions from the questions. Once students have started a
quiz, you usually never want the tool to touch it again. The top-level
`pinned_resources` array freezes content so it is **never uploaded**:

```toml
pinned_resources = [
    "quizzes/01-getting-to-know-you",           # a folder pins everything inside it
    "pages/exam-instructions.md",               # or pin a single file
]
```

Paths are **relative to the repo root**. A folder entry covers every file
under it (for a quiz: the quiz `.md` and all its question files); pinning the
quiz's `.md` file directly works too. Any content type can be pinned — pages,
assignments, discussions, quizzes, question banks, modules, assets, the
syllabus.

While a resource is pinned:

* **It is never uploaded.** The pin wins over `--force-uploads` and over
  naming the file explicitly with `-t`/`-s`. The *only* way to sync it again
  is to remove it from `pinned_resources`.
* **You get a soft warning, not an error.** When the resource has local
  changes that would otherwise upload, `update` prints
  `WARNING: … pinned (pinned_resources in course_settings.toml); NOT uploaded`,
  lists the skipped resources in an end-of-run summary, and continues; the run
  still succeeds. An up-to-date pinned resource stays silent.
* **`prune` won't delete or unpublish it**, even if you delete the local file
  (`prune --manifest`, which never contacts Canvas, is exempt).
* **`mv` keeps the pin attached**: moving or renaming a pinned resource
  rewrites its `pinned_resources` entry along with the manifest and links.

A `pinned_resources` entry that matches nothing in the repo produces a warning
(typo protection); it is not an error, since a pin may deliberately outlive
its local file to keep `prune` away from the Canvas object.

**You cannot pin an individual quiz question.** A quiz (or question bank)
syncs as a single unit, so a pin on a file inside its folder — e.g.
`"quizzes/my-quiz/questions/q1.md"` — could not be honored: the quiz would
still sync and still delete/re-create that question. Rather than silently
ignore the pin, the tool treats it as a config error and **stops the entire
update immediately** (before anything is uploaded), telling you to pin the
whole quiz folder instead. Only the quiz folder or its main `.md` file (the
bank folder or its main `.toml`) are valid pin targets under `quizzes/` and
`question_banks/`.

### Syllabus (`course_settings/syllabus.md`)

The Markdown body of this file is uploaded as the course's **syllabus** (the
Canvas "Syllabus" page). Frontmatter is optional and ignored — only the body is
used. Cross-links to other local files are rewritten to Canvas URLs, just like in
pages.

```markdown
---
title: "Syllabus"   # optional and ignored — only the Markdown body below is uploaded
---

# Welcome to CS 101

Class meets MWF 10–11 in Room 200.

See the [Week 1 Assignment](../assignments/week1.md) and the
[grading policy](../snippets/grading-policy.md).
```

### Rubrics (`course_settings/rubrics.toml`)

Optional. Defines reusable grading rubrics for the course. Read during the same
course-settings sync as `course_settings.toml`. Rubrics are matched **by title** —
a rubric whose title already exists in Canvas is **updated in place** (reported as
`Updated rubric: …`); missing rubrics are created (`Created rubric: …`).

Change detection is per rubric: when `rubrics.toml` changes, only the rubrics whose
content actually changed are re-sent (each rubric's content hash is cached in
the manifest); use `--force-uploads` to re-send all of them.

**If a rubric is deleted on Canvas, the tool repairs it automatically.** Canvas
deletes a rubric as soon as its last association is removed, and a deleted rubric
disappears from the API's rubric list *even though the course's Rubrics page still
shows it* — so this looks like the tool failing to find a rubric that is plainly
there. Every run compares `rubrics.toml` against the rubrics Canvas actually lists;
a rubric that has gone missing is reported and re-created:

```text
  NOTICE: rubric '01 Coding Exercise Rubric' is in rubrics.toml but no longer on Canvas (deleted there); re-creating it
Syncing rubrics...
  Created rubric: 01 Coding Exercise Rubric
Repairing rubric associations...
  Re-associated rubric '01 Coding Exercise Rubric': assignments/01-b-unit-worksheets.md
```

The re-created rubric gets a **new** Canvas id (Canvas does not restore the deleted
one), so every assignment whose frontmatter names that rubric is re-associated with
it — including assignments whose own `.md` files were up to date and therefore
skipped. Assignments referencing a rubric by numeric id instead of title are left
alone; there is no title to re-resolve, so fix those by hand.

```toml
# course_settings/rubrics.toml — array-of-tables, one [[rubrics]] block per rubric.

[[rubrics]]
title = "Essay Rubric"   # matched by title; updated in place if it already exists
reusable = true          # share one rubric across assignments (default: not sent)
read_only = false        # allow instructors to edit the rubric (default: not sent)

# One [[rubrics.criteria]] block per row of the rubric:
[[rubrics.criteria]]
description = "Thesis"
long_description = "Evaluates the clarity and strength of the thesis statement."
points = 5
# One [[rubrics.criteria.ratings]] block per rating level (highest first):
[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Clear and arguable"
long_description = "Thesis is specific, debatable, and well-positioned."
points = 5
[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Present but weak"
points = 3
[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Missing"
points = 0

[[rubrics.criteria]]
description = "Evidence"
points = 5
[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Well supported"
points = 5
[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Unsupported"
points = 0
```

`long_description` is optional at both criterion and rating levels. When present,
it is sent to Canvas as the extended description (visible when expanding a rubric
row). When absent or empty, only `description` and `points` are sent.

`reusable` and `read_only` are optional rubric-level flags sent to Canvas when
present. `reusable = true` means Canvas shares one rubric instance across all
assignments that reference it (instead of copying per assignment). `read_only =
false` (the default the `import` command writes) lets instructors edit the rubric
in the Canvas UI.

When writing a rubric from scratch, only `title`, `description`, `points`, and
`ratings` are required. A minimal rubric looks like:

```toml
[[rubrics]]
title = "My Rubric"

[[rubrics.criteria]]
description = "Quality"
points = 5

[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Excellent"
points = 5

[[rubrics.criteria.ratings]]
description = "Poor"
points = 0
```

> The `import` command also writes metadata to each rubric and criterion
> (`identifier`, `points_possible`, `criterion_id`, rating `id`, etc.). Those
> extra fields are preserved in the file but **ignored on upload** — you do not
> need them when creating rubrics by hand, and `import` writes them **commented
> out** so you can see at a glance which fields are live. (Rating `id`s are the
> one exception: they sit inside inline `ratings = [...]` tables and so cannot
> be commented out individually. They are still ignored on upload.) The
> `import` command always sets
> `read_only = false` and `reusable = true`, regardless of the values in the
> IMSCC export, so that imported rubrics are editable and shared.

### Other `course_settings/` files (import-only)

The `import` command also produces the two files below. They are **not yet
uploaded** by the sync (no Canvas upload path exists for them yet — see `TODO.md`);
they are written so the data survives an import and is available for a future
release. Documented here for completeness.

**`course_settings/events.md`** — course calendar events, one per `##` heading:

```markdown
---
title: "Course Events"
---

## Midterm Exam

**Date:** 2025-02-14T10:00:00-08:00

Bring a pencil and your student ID.

## Spring Break (no class)

**Date:** 2025-03-24 (all day)
```

**`course_settings/files_meta.toml`** — per-file and per-folder visibility metadata
(locking, hiding, display names). `import` writes a banner at the top of this
file saying that nothing in it is uploaded:

```toml
# course_settings/files_meta.toml — import-only.
#
# Every setting in this file is recorded for round-trip fidelity with the
# original cartridge. markdown-to-canvas does not upload any of it, so
# editing this file has no effect on Canvas.

[[folders]]
path = "course files/handouts"
hidden = false                       # true = hidden from students

[[files]]
identifier  = "gabc123"              # IMSCC resource id (from the export)
display_name = "Worksheet 1.docx"
locked      = false                  # true = locked
hidden      = false                  # true = hidden from students
unlock_at   = "2025-02-01T00:00:00-08:00"   # available to students from this time
```

### Page (`pages/`)

```markdown
---
title: "Syllabus"        # defaults to the filename if omitted
editing_roles: teachers  # who may edit in Canvas: teachers | students
                         #   | "teachers,students" | members | public
published: true          # true = visible to students; false = draft (the default)
---

## Course Syllabus

Welcome to the course. See [Week 1 Assignment](../assignments/week1.md).
```

Pages are updated in place on Canvas when re-synced.

**Images in Markdown:**  Pandoc turns a standalone image paragraph into a `<figure>` with a visible caption. Use the trailing-backslash trick to suppress the caption, or leave the alt text empty for decorative images:

| Goal | Markdown |
| --- | --- |
| Image with alt text, no visible caption | `![Alt text](image.svg)\` (trailing `\`) |
| Decorative image (no alt, no caption) | `![](image.svg)` |
| Image with visible caption | `![Caption text](image.svg)` (standalone paragraph) |

**Accessibility (decorative images):** an image whose alt text is empty (or only spaces) is automatically marked as decorative in the uploaded HTML — it gets `alt=""` and `role="presentation"`, the same markup the Canvas editor produces when you tick "Decorative image". This keeps the Canvas accessibility checker happy and tells screen readers to skip the image. Images with real alt text are left alone, so every image is accessible either way: give meaningful images alt text, and leave the alt text empty for purely decorative ones.

**WARNING:**  Make sure that you start your headers at H2.  **DO NOT USE H1 HEADERS!!!**  
Canvas will translate the H1 headers into styled normal paragraphs so it looks right but
will not work correctly with screen readers!!

```

**Assignment group, rubric, group assignments, anonymous/moderated grading, and
peer reviews** are all settable from the frontmatter above. A few caveats:

* **Assignment group:** `assignment_group_id` accepts either the group name as a
  string (e.g. `"Labs"`) or a numeric Canvas ID. When a name is given the tool
  resolves it to the Canvas ID using the groups defined in `course_settings.toml`.
  If the name is not found a warning is printed and the field is skipped. This
  field works the same way on every graded content type — assignments, quizzes
  (see [Quiz](#quiz-quizzes)), and graded discussions (see
  [Discussion](#discussion-discussions)).
* **Rubric:** `rubric` accepts either a rubric title (string) or numeric Canvas
  rubric ID. When a title is given the tool resolves it to the Canvas ID using
  rubrics defined in `course_settings/rubrics.toml`. A rubric association is
  created (or updated) on each assignment sync. `use_for_grading` defaults to
  `true`; set it to `false` for advisory-only (feedback without grade impact)
  rubrics.
* **Group set:** Canvas identifies a group set (group *category*) by numeric ID,
  not by name. This tool does **not** create or manage group sets — create the
  group set in the Canvas UI (or via the API) first, then put its numeric
  `group_category_id` here. (The ID appears in the URL when you view the group
  set in Canvas: `.../groups#tab-<id>`.)
* **Moderated grading:** Canvas requires `grader_count` (and usually
  `final_grader_id`) when `moderated_grading` is `true`. `final_grader_id` is a
  Canvas **user** ID.

### Discussion (`discussions/`)

Discussions are updated in place on Canvas when re-synced.

A discussion is **ungraded** unless you add the grading fields (`points_possible`,
`due_at`, `lock_at`, `unlock_at`, `assignment_group_id`). Including any of them
attaches a Canvas assignment and makes the discussion graded; omit them all for
an ungraded discussion.

```markdown
---
title: "Week 1 Discussion"   # defaults to the filename if omitted
published: true              # true = visible to students; false = draft (the default)
require_initial_post: true   # students must post before they can see classmates' replies

# Grading fields — include these to make the discussion graded; delete them
# all for a plain, ungraded discussion:
points_possible: 10
due_at:    "2025-02-01T23:59:00-05:00"
unlock_at: "2025-01-27T00:00:00-05:00"
lock_at:   "2025-02-08T23:59:00-05:00"
assignment_group_id: "Labs"  # name of an assignment group defined in
                             #   course_settings.toml, or a numeric Canvas ID
---

Post your initial response by Wednesday, then reply to two classmates.
```

### Announcement (`announcements/`)

Files in `announcements/` become Canvas **announcements** (internally a discussion
topic with `is_announcement=true`). They are updated in place on Canvas when
re-synced.

The key difference from other content: **Canvas has no "draft" state for
announcements** — creating one posts it immediately. So `published` controls
whether the announcement is sent to Canvas *at all*:

* `published: false` → **not posted.** `update` skips the file (with a warning)
  and it stays staged in your repo. This lets you keep a set of announcements
  ready and release each one when the time is right (e.g. the midterm reminder).
* `published: true` → **posted now** (or scheduled, if you set `delayed_post_at`).

To release a staged announcement, change its `published` to `true` and run
`update`. Announcements cannot be graded, so grading/due-date fields do not apply.

```markdown
---
title: "Midterm Reminder"    # defaults to the filename if omitted
published: false             # false = staged, not posted (default); true = post it now

# Optional Canvas announcement settings (all omittable):
delayed_post_at: "2025-10-13T08:00:00-07:00"  # schedule automatic posting at this time
lock_at: "2025-10-20T23:59:00-07:00"          # stop accepting comments at this time
locked: true                 # lock the announcement (no comments)
discussion_type: threaded    # "threaded" or "side_comment"
require_initial_post: true   # readers must comment before seeing others' comments
allow_rating: true           # let users "like" comments
---

The midterm is **next week** — review the study guide and come prepared.
```

The optional settings above are forwarded to Canvas only when present. (There is
no ordering field: Canvas always lists announcements newest-first by post date,
so `position` has no effect and is not used.)

Any *other* frontmatter field — a typo, or a Canvas setting the tool doesn't
support — is **not** sent silently: `update` prints a `WARNING: … ignoring
frontmatter field '…'` when it processes the file and repeats the full list in a
summary at the end of the run, so you always know exactly what was skipped.

When you import a Canvas export, announcements are written here automatically with
`published: false`, and the original export metadata is preserved as commented-out
frontmatter — uncomment any of the supported settings above to apply it on the
next `update` (see [IMSCC import](#imscc-import)).

### Module (`modules/`)

Module files don't have a body that becomes HTML. The body lists content items and text headers (SubHeaders). Links to local `.md` files become Canvas content items; absolute URLs become ExternalUrl items.

**Sync behavior:** When a module is synced, the module itself is updated in place on Canvas, but all of its items (content links, SubHeaders, ExternalUrls) are deleted and re-created from the module file.

```markdown
---
title: "Week 1: Introduction"          # defaults to the filename if omitted
published: true                        # true = visible to students; false = draft (the default)
unlock_at: "2025-01-20T00:00:00-05:00" # module stays locked until this time
require_sequential_progress: false     # true = students must complete items in order
---

## Readings                            <!-- a "## heading" becomes a SubHeader at indent 0 -->

- [Syllabus](../pages/syllabus.md)                  <!-- link to a local .md → content item -->
- [Course Website](https://example.com)              <!-- absolute URL → ExternalUrl item -->

## Work

- [Week 1 Assignment](../assignments/week1.md)
- [Week 1 Discussion](../discussions/week1-intro.md)
- [Week 1 Quiz](../quizzes/week-1-quiz/week-1-quiz.md)
- Please read the instructions carefully    <!-- plain-text list item → SubHeader at indent 1 -->
```

The module body uses four kinds of lines:

* A `## heading` becomes a **SubHeader** item at indent level 0.
* A **plain-text list item** (no link) becomes a **SubHeader** item starting at indent level 1. Indenting with leading spaces increases the level (2 spaces per level).
* A bullet linking to a local `.md` file becomes a **content item** (Page,
  Assignment, Discussion, or Quiz — inferred from the target's folder).
* A bullet linking to an absolute `http(s)://` URL becomes an **ExternalUrl** item.

ExternalUrl items default to `new_tab: true` (Canvas opens the link in a new window). Add `<!-- target="_self" -->` after the link to embed in an iframe instead.

**Per-item published state:** By default every item in a module is published (visible to students). To mark an individual item as unpublished, add `<!-- published="false" -->` after the link:

```markdown
- [Visible Page](../pages/intro.md)
- [Hidden Draft](../pages/draft.md) <!-- published="false" -->
- [Hidden Link](https://example.com) <!-- published="false" -->
```

This sets the Canvas module item's published state — the item still appears in Canvas for instructors but is hidden from students. Multiple attributes can be combined in a single comment: `<!-- target="_self" published="false" -->`.

> **Known Canvas limitation:** The Canvas API returns a server error (500) when
> trying to set `published=false` on **File-type** module items (e.g. `.docx`,
> `.pdf`, or other non-Markdown assets linked directly in a module). Pages,
> assignments, discussions, quizzes, and external URLs all work correctly. For
> File items the tool prints a summary at the end listing which items you need
> to unpublish manually in the Canvas web UI.

Unpublished items are also excluded from the `publish` subcommand's static website (including any assets reachable only through unpublished links).

**Module-level `published` overrides its contents.** A module's own frontmatter
(`published: true` / `published: false`) controls the module, and in Canvas the
module's publish state **cascades to everything inside it**: unpublishing a
module unpublishes every item *and the underlying content* (pages, assignments,
discussions, quizzes). So if a content file's own frontmatter says
`published: true` but it lives in a module whose frontmatter says
`published: false`, the module wins — the content is left **unpublished** after
sync (invisible to students), regardless of its own `published: true`.

Because this is easy to miss (the run still reports success), the tool now
**warns** when it detects this conflict — inline as the module syncs, and again
in an end-of-run summary listing each affected item:

```text
The following content asks to be published (published: true) but sits in a
module that is unpublished (published: false).
Canvas unpublishes a module's contents along with the module, so this content
is NOT visible to students despite its own published: true.
Publish the module (set published: true in its .md file), or move the item to a
published module:
  In module "Midterm Exam": "Midterm Exam Study Guide" (pages/exams/midterm/midterm-exam-study-guide.md)
```

To fix, either set `published: true` on the module, or move the item to a module
that is published. (Assets/Files carry no `published:` frontmatter of their own,
so they are not reported — an unpublished module simply hides them, as expected.)

The `import` subcommand preserves per-item published state from the Canvas export — unpublished items in the original course get the `<!-- published="false" -->` comment automatically.

**Item indentation:** Indent list items with leading spaces to set their Canvas indentation level. Every 2 spaces of indentation adds one indent level. Canvas supports indent levels 0-5; deeper indentation is clamped to 5 with a warning.

```markdown
## Welcome                                          <!-- SubHeader indent 0 -->

- [Course Overview](../pages/overview.md)           <!-- indent 0 (flush left) -->

## Useful Links                                     <!-- SubHeader indent 0 -->

  - [Grading Guide](../pages/grading.md)            <!-- indent 1 (2 spaces) -->
  - [Zoom Links](../pages/zoom.md)                  <!-- indent 1 -->
    - [Zoom Etiquette](../pages/zoom-etiquette.md)  <!-- indent 2 (4 spaces) -->
  - Important reminder about Zoom                   <!-- SubHeader indent 2 -->
    - Another note                                  <!-- SubHeader indent 3 -->
```

Top-level `## headings` always appear at indent level 0. Plain-text list items start at indent 1 (flush `- text`) and increase with nesting. The same indentation is preserved in the published website.

**Module display order** is controlled by `course_settings/module_order.toml`. Without this file, modules are synced in alphabetical filename order. Create the file to assign explicit Canvas positions:

```toml
# course_settings/module_order.toml
# Lists modules in the order they should appear in Canvas (position 1 = top).
# An entry ending in .md is a file in the modules/ directory; any other entry
# is the name of a module that exists only on Canvas.
# Modules not listed here are placed after all listed ones by Canvas.
order = [
    "week-1.md",
    "week-2.md",
    "final-exam.md",
]
```

When this file is modified, the tool repositions the listed modules on Canvas without re-syncing their content. If a listed module isn't found locally or hasn't been synced to Canvas yet, a warning is printed and the run reports failure. This file is also generated automatically by the `import` subcommand, preserving the module order from the original Canvas export.

#### Ordering modules that exist only on Canvas

Some modules in your course are not yours to manage — a college-wide orientation module dropped into every shell, for instance. You can still control where they sit relative to your own modules by listing them **by their Canvas name**:

```toml
order = [
    "Getting Started at Cascadia",   # created on Canvas, no local file
    "week-1.md",
    "week-2.md",
]
```

How an entry is resolved:

* Ends in `.md` → a file in `modules/`. Missing on disk, or never synced to Canvas, is a warning and a failed run.
* Anything else → the name of a module on Canvas. The name is matched ignoring capitalization and surrounding whitespace.

The tool never creates, edits, deletes, or unpublishes a module it knows only by name — it only sets its position.

Two cases are errors (warning printed, run reports failure, that one entry is left where it is):

* **No Canvas module has that name.** Also what you get from a typo in a filename that lost its `.md`.
* **Two or more Canvas modules share that name.** The tool will not guess which one you meant; rename one on Canvas.

An empty string in `order` is rejected outright, since it names nothing.

Once resolved, the module's Canvas ID is cached in the manifest so later runs skip the lookup:

```toml
["canvas_modules/Getting Started at Cascadia"]
canvas_id = 4213
canvas_type = "external_module"
```

If the college later deletes or renames that module, the cached ID stops working; the tool notices, looks the name up again, and refreshes the cache. These cache entries have no local file by design, and `prune` ignores them — it will never offer to delete the college's module.

### Quiz (`quizzes/`)

Each quiz lives in its own sub-folder. The folder name becomes the quiz slug.

**Sync behavior:** When a quiz is synced, the quiz itself is updated in place on Canvas, but all of its questions are deleted and re-created from the question files. The publish state is applied after the questions, so a quiz that becomes published during the sync goes live with its new questions — no manual step needed.

> **Once students have started a quiz, pin it.** Deleting and re-creating the
> questions disconnects existing submissions from them. Add the quiz folder to
> [`pinned_resources`](#pinned-resources-pinned_resources) in
> `course_settings.toml` and the tool will never touch it again (warning you
> if it otherwise would have), no matter what flags you pass.

> **Updating an already-published quiz:** Canvas holds question changes to a
> published quiz as a pending draft — students keep seeing the old questions,
> and the quiz page shows an "unsaved changes" banner. The Canvas API offers no
> way to accept those changes programmatically, so the tool prints a warning
> with a link to the quiz: open it and click **Save It Now**. (Unpublishing and
> re-publishing would work around it, but Canvas forbids that once students have
> submissions and it re-sends notifications, so the tool doesn't do it.)

```

**Quiz-level file** — frontmatter holds settings; the body is an optional description followed by a numbered list of links to question files (order = Canvas question order):

```markdown
---

assignment_group_id: "Labs"  # name of an assignment group defined in

                             #   only affects grading for graded quiz_type values
                             #   (assignment, graded_survey) — see note below
---

Read each question carefully.   <!-- optional description; everything that isn't a
                                     numbered question link becomes the quiz body -->

1. [What is 2+2?](questions/what-is-2-plus-2.md)
2. [Explain gravity](questions/explain-gravity.md)
```

**Commenting out questions:** wrap question links in a
[course-flag conditional](#course-flags--conditional-content-if--elif--else--endif)
and they are skipped when the branch is false — not uploaded, not shown in the
description. The numbers on the remaining links don't need to be renumbered;
question order comes from list order, not the numbers.

```markdown
1. [What is 2+2?](questions/what-is-2-plus-2.md)
<!-- #if include_gravity -->
2. [Explain gravity](questions/explain-gravity.md)
<!-- #endif -->
3. [Explain magnets](questions/explain-magnets.md)
```

**Assignment group:** `assignment_group_id` works the same way as it does for
[assignments](#assignment-assignments) — a group name resolved via
`course_settings.toml`, or a numeric Canvas ID. Canvas only uses it for grading
when `quiz_type` is `assignment` or `graded_survey`; it has no effect for
`practice_quiz` or `survey` since those aren't graded.

**Question files** — each question is a separate `.md` file. Every question type shares these fields:

| Field             | Default if omitted | Notes                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `title`           | filename stem      | Shown as the question name in Canvas |
| `question_type`   | `essay_question`   | See types below                      |
| `points_possible` | `0`                |                                      |

**Supported question types and their required fields:**

> **Note:** None of these fields are required for the *sync to succeed* — a question with missing fields will upload without errors. However, the question will be ungradable in Canvas until the fields are provided.

| Question type                | Fields needed to be gradable                                                         |

> `fill_in_blank_question` and `pattern_match_question` are both uploaded to Canvas
> as a *Short Answer* question. For `pattern_match_question`, only the **first**
> entry in `answers` is used.

Example MCQ question file (the `## Answers` list numbering is ignored — choices are
read in order, and `correct` is the 1-based position of the right one):

```markdown
---
title: "What is 2+2?"              # defaults to the filename if omitted
question_type: multiple_choice_question
points_possible: 1
correct: 2                        # 1-based index into the ## Answers list below
---

What is the result of adding 2 and 2?

## Answers

1. 3
2. 4
3. 5
```

Example multiple-response question file (`correct` is a list of 1-based indices):

```markdown
---
title: "Which are prime numbers?"
question_type: multiple_response_question
points_possible: 2
correct: [1, 3]                   # answers 2 and 4 are wrong
---

Select all of the prime numbers.

## Answers

1. 2
2. 4
3. 5
4. 6
```

Example true/false question file:

```markdown
---
title: "The sky is blue"
question_type: true_false_question
points_possible: 1
correct: true                     # true or false
---

The sky appears blue during the day due to Rayleigh scattering.
```

Example fill-in-the-blank question file (any listed string counts as correct):

```markdown
---
title: "Capital of France"
question_type: fill_in_blank_question
points_possible: 1
answers: ["Paris", "paris"]       # accepted answers (case matters in Canvas)
---

The capital of France is ____.
```

Example pattern-match question file (only the first pattern is used):

```markdown
---
title: "Name a primary color"
question_type: pattern_match_question
points_possible: 1
answers: ["red"]                  # accepted as a substring match
match_type: substring             # optional; written by `import`
---

Type one primary color.
```

Example essay question file (manually graded — no `correct`/`answers` needed):

```markdown
---
title: "Explain gravity"
question_type: essay_question
points_possible: 5
---

In 3–5 paragraphs, explain the concept of gravity.
```

**Optional feedback and sample solutions** — any question type may add a
`## Feedback` section with up to four subsections, and essay questions may add a
`## Sample Solution`:

```markdown
---
title: "What is 2+2?"
question_type: multiple_choice_question
points_possible: 1
correct: 2
---

What is the result of adding 2 and 2?

## Answers

1. 3
2. 4
3. 5

## Feedback

### General

Shown to every student regardless of their answer.

### Correct

Shown when the student answers correctly.

### Incorrect

Shown when the student answers incorrectly.

### Per-answer

For MCQ, multiple-response, and true/false questions only — feedback shown when
the student picks one specific answer, keyed by the answer's 1-based position in
`## Answers` (or `1`/`2` for True/False, matching `True` then `False`). The word
`answer` is matched case-insensitively (`import` always writes it lowercase, as
shown below):

```markdown
### Per-answer

- answer 1: Feedback shown if the student picks answer 1.
- answer 2: Feedback shown if the student picks answer 2.
```

A line after an `- answer N:` item that isn't itself a new `- answer M:` item is
treated as a continuation of that item's feedback (a second paragraph, etc.).

## Sample Solution

For essay-type questions, this text is uploaded as the question's neutral
(general) comment. Ignored if a `## Feedback` → `### General` block is also present.
```

> The `import` command may also emit a commented-out `# original_answer_ids:`
> line in a question's frontmatter. It's preserved for round-tripping but is
> never sent to Canvas on upload — nothing consumes it.

### Question banks (`question_banks/`)

A question bank is a reusable pool of questions (not attached to a single quiz).
Each bank lives in its own sub-folder under `question_banks/`; the folder holds a
`.toml` settings file (named after the folder) and a `questions/` directory.

```text
question_banks/
└── midterm-pool/
    ├── midterm-pool.toml       ← bank settings
    └── questions/
        ├── what-is-2-plus-2.md
        └── explain-gravity.md
```

The bank's `.toml` file holds just the bank title:

```toml
# question_banks/midterm-pool/midterm-pool.toml
bank_title = "Midterm Pool"   # defaults to the folder name if omitted
```

The question files use the **exact same format** as quiz question files (see
[Quiz (`quizzes/`)](#quiz-quizzes) above) — all question types, the `## Answers`
section, and the `## Feedback` / `## Sample Solution` sections all work the same way.

> Question banks **cannot be uploaded to Canvas**. Canvas's public API has no way
> to create or update a question bank (its question-bank endpoints are read-only),
> so `update` checks each bank's question files for errors, prints a warning, and
> skips the upload. To stop the warning, add `question_banks/**` to `.canvasignore`
> (the `.canvasignore` written by `import` already does this). Banks imported from
> a Canvas export are useful as a local reference copy; edits to them have to be
> made in Canvas by hand.

### Snippets

Any Markdown link whose target resolves inside `snippets/` is replaced with the snippet's content before conversion. Snippets are expanded in all Markdown file types — pages, assignments, discussions, modules, quizzes, question files, and question banks. Useful for office hours, shared policies, etc.

> **Editing a snippet propagates automatically on the next full `update`/`publish` run.** The tool tracks which snippets each file references and treats that file as stale if any referenced snippet changed since it was last synced — you don't need `--force-uploads` or to `touch` anything. The one exception: a narrow `-s`/`-t` run stays strictly scoped to the files you named. If you run `-s assignments/week1.md` and a snippet shared with `assignments/week2.md` changed, only `week1.md` re-syncs — `week2.md` picks up the change on the next full `update`/`publish`.

```markdown
<!-- in pages/syllabus.md -->
[My Office Hours](../snippets/office-hours.md)
```

```markdown
<!-- snippets/office-hours.md -->
Office hours are Tuesdays 2–4 pm in Building 7, Room 201.
```

#### Inline snippets and the `CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE` snippet

Snippets can also be embedded *inline* using a dollar-sign-fenced path:

```text
$path/to/snippet.md$
```

The path is relative to the file that contains the reference. Before conversion the tool replaces the whole `$…$` token with the snippet's content (whitespace-stripped), making it safe to embed inside a Markdown link URL or anywhere else in text.

The most common use is `snippets/inline/CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE.md`, which holds the full Canvas course base URL (protocol, institution hostname, and course ID). Links that point into your own course can reference it, keeping the institution name and course ID in one place:

```markdown
<!-- in pages/overview.md -->
Go through the list of your [Grades]($../snippets/inline/CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE.md$/grades "Grades") here in Canvas.
```

```markdown
<!-- snippets/inline/CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE.md -->
https://cascadia.instructure.com/courses/2735320
```

Before conversion, `$../snippets/inline/CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE.md$` is replaced with the snippet content, producing:

```markdown
Go through the list of your [Grades](https://cascadia.instructure.com/courses/2735320/grades "Grades") here in Canvas.
```

The snippet file name is written in ALL CAPS to make it visually distinct from regular (lowercase) snippet files.

> **Note on `$` in links** — Inside a Markdown link URL, `$` has no special meaning and is valid in HTML `href` attributes (RFC 3986 sub-delimiter). The preprocessing step runs before Pandoc, so there is no conflict with Pandoc's `$…$` math syntax. The link will appear broken in a Markdown editor preview, but the Markdown structure itself is unaffected.

**The `import` subcommand creates this snippet automatically.** When you import a `.imscc` file, the tool reads the institution hostname and course ID from the export metadata and writes `snippets/inline/CANVAS_COURSE_REFERENCE.md` with the full base URL. Every Markdown link whose URL starts with that base URL is rewritten to use the `$path$` snippet reference, with the link text added as a hover title.

#### Shared frontmatter via `PASTE_SNIPPET_INTO_FRONTMATTER`

The two snippet forms above only reuse **body** content. To reuse **frontmatter** values — e.g. every "worksheet" assignment sharing the same `points_possible` and `rubric` — lead the body with one or more links of the form:

```markdown
---
title: "Worksheet 1"
canvas_type: assignment
published: true
---
[PASTE_SNIPPET_INTO_FRONTMATTER](../snippets/worksheet-defaults.md)
[PASTE_SNIPPET_INTO_FRONTMATTER](../snippets/another-snippet.md)

Do the worksheet...
```

```yaml
<!-- snippets/worksheet-defaults.md -->
points_possible: 50
rubric: "Worksheet Rubric"
submission_types: [online_upload]
```

Each referenced file must be a plain YAML mapping (not Markdown prose) — its keys are merged into the file's own frontmatter before the rest of processing. Rules:

* The link text must be exactly `PASTE_SNIPPET_INTO_FRONTMATTER` (case-sensitive) — this is what makes the reference visually distinct and lets you Ctrl+click it in VS Code to jump straight to the shared defaults file.
* These lines must be the **first thing in the body** — only blank/whitespace-only lines may precede or separate them. The scan stops at the first line that isn't blank and isn't a `PASTE_SNIPPET_INTO_FRONTMATTER` link; everything from there on is treated as ordinary body content.
* Multiple references are merged in order, later snippets overriding earlier ones for any keys they share.
* The file's own frontmatter always wins over snippet values, so a single file can still override one or two fields from a shared default.
* Nested includes (a frontmatter snippet referencing another snippet) are not supported.

This is a different tool than the centralized `due_dates` table in `course_settings.toml` (see [Centralized due dates](#course_settingstoml)): `due_dates` is for fields that should mostly be *unique per item* but reviewed in one place; `PASTE_SNIPPET_INTO_FRONTMATTER` is for fields that should be *identical* across many files, edited once and reflected everywhere that includes the snippet (after a re-sync — see the staleness caveat above).

### Course flags — conditional content (`#if` / `#elif` / `#else` / `#endif`)

If you teach the same course in multiple variants (in-person vs. online,
different quarters), course flags let one repo produce different Canvas content
per offering. Define boolean flags once in `course_settings.toml`:

```toml
# course_settings/course_settings.toml
[course_flags]
in_person_class = true
hybrid          = false
```

then gate regions of any Markdown body with HTML-comment directives, each alone
on its own line:

```markdown
<!-- #if in_person_class -->
Bring your laptop to Room 302.

We will pair up during the first hour.
<!-- #elif hybrid -->
Attend in person **or** on Zoom — your choice this week.
<!-- #else -->
Join the Zoom link posted in the module.
<!-- #endif -->
```

Switching offerings is then a one-line change in `course_settings.toml`
followed by an `update` run.

**Per-section values.** A `canvas.toml` may carry its own `[course_flags]`
table, which overrides the same-named flags in `course_settings.toml` for runs
that use that config (`--config`); flags defined in only one of the two files
are kept. That is how one repo drives several sections that differ — see
[Several Canvas courses from one repo](#several-canvas-courses-from-one-repo).
An invalid flag name or non-boolean value is a fatal config error in either
file, and the error message names the file it came from.

**Condition syntax.** `#if`/`#elif` take exactly one flag name, optionally
preceded by the word `not` (`<!-- #if not in_person_class -->`). There is no
`and`/`or`/parentheses and no `!` operator. `#if flag` is true when the flag is
defined **and** `true`; `#if not flag` when defined and `false`. A flag that is
not defined in `[course_flags]` is a **hard error** in both forms — there is no
"undefined means false" — so a typo'd flag name can never silently hide
content. The file with the error is skipped (not uploaded / not staged) and the
run reports the error. Nesting is supported; `#elif`/`#else`/`#endif` bind to
the innermost open `#if`.

**Where it works.** Directives are evaluated in the body of every Markdown file
the tool processes: pages, assignments, discussions, announcements, the
syllabus, quizzes (description **and** the numbered question list — so a whole
question can be conditional), question files, question banks, module files (so
a module item can be conditional), and snippets. Excluding a quiz question or
module item behaves exactly as if you had deleted that line: the question /
module item is removed from Canvas on the next sync. Frontmatter is never
processed — flags gate body content only. `publish` applies the **same** flag
values, so the static site matches the Canvas variant.

**Blank lines matter.** Directive lines are removed entirely (no blank line
left behind), so adjacent text can merge into one paragraph — which is exactly
what keeps a conditional list item inside a single tight list:

```markdown
- Always shown
<!-- #if in_person_class -->
- In-person only item
<!-- #endif -->
- Also always shown
```

If you want the conditional text to be its own paragraph, put blank lines
*inside* the branch.

**Notes and gotchas:**

* In GitHub/VSCode *preview*, **all** branches render — nothing evaluates the
  flags there. The markers themselves are invisible in preview and show as
  grey comments in the editor; the enclosed content stays fully
  highlighted/rendered Markdown.
* Directives inside fenced code blocks are literal example text; the block as
  a whole is kept or dropped by the surrounding conditional.
* Other HTML comments (`<!-- #region -->`, `<!-- published:false -->`,
  ordinary comments) pass through untouched. The misspellings `#ifdef`,
  `#ifndef`, `#elseif`, `#elsif`, and `#fi` are caught with a
  "did you mean" error.
* Directives must be balanced within each file, and within each snippet file
  independently (an `#if` opened in a page can't be closed inside an included
  snippet).
* The flag values each file used are cached in the manifest
  (`flags_used`), so flipping a flag re-syncs **only** the files whose output
  could change — not the whole course. With `-v` the tool prints why:
  `re-syncing: flag 'in_person_class' changed true → false`.
* A flag defined in `[course_flags]` but used by no content file produces a
  warning (never an error). Deleting a flag that files still reference makes
  those files re-sync and fail loudly with the undefined-flag error.
* A file whose entire body is excluded still exists on Canvas, just with an
  empty body — whole-resource exclusion is a possible future feature (see
  TODO.md).

#### `published_if`: gating a whole item by flag

For the common case of hiding a whole page/assignment/discussion/quiz from
one offering rather than conditionally emptying its body, set `published_if`
in frontmatter instead of a literal `published:`:

```yaml
---
title: "Lab 3 (in-person only)"
published_if: in_person_class   # or: published_if: not hybrid
---
```

`published_if` computes the effective `published` value from a course flag —
same condition syntax as `#if` (one flag name, optionally preceded by `not`).
An undefined flag is a hard error, same as `#if`; combining `published_if`
with a literal `published:` key on the same file is also a hard error
(ambiguous — remove one). The content stays synced and visible to
instructors either way; only its Canvas publish state toggles, so flipping
the flag and re-running `update` unpublishes/republishes it. **Announcements
are excluded** — Canvas has no way to un-post one once created, so
`published_if` on an announcement is a hard error; use a literal `published:`
there.

Like body directives, the flag `published_if` referenced is recorded in
`flags_used`, so flipping it re-syncs exactly the files that need it. A
module item with no explicit `{published:false}` override still defers to
the referenced file's own `published`/`published_if` frontmatter, exactly as
it does today for a literal `published:`.

#### `only_if`: excluding a `due_dates` entry by flag

A `due_dates` entry (see [Centralized due dates](#centralized-due-dates)) can
carry an optional `only_if` key so a date override only applies to one
offering:

```toml
due_dates = [
    { name = "Lab 3", due_at = "2025-03-01T23:59:00", unlock_at = "KEEP", lock_at = "KEEP", only_if = "in_person_class" },
]
```

`only_if` takes the same `flag_name` / `not flag_name` syntax and is
evaluated once, right after the `due_dates` table is loaded — an entry whose
condition is false is dropped before anything else sees it (no API call, and
it won't produce a "changed" cache update). An undefined flag or malformed
condition is a whole-run configuration error, same as an invalid
`[course_flags]` entry. The due-dates coverage warning ("no due_dates entry
for …") is not affected by `only_if` on its own — but an item that is itself
excluded via `published_if` for this offering is treated as expected to have
no `due_dates` entry, so it doesn't produce a spurious warning.

---

## Manifest file

The tool creates a manifest in your course repo, named after the `canvas.toml`
it is syncing with: `course_settings/canvas.toml` → `.manifest-canvas.toml`,
`course_settings/canvas-sec-a.toml` → `.manifest-canvas-sec-a.toml`. The
manifest is local to your machine and must never be committed: it records the
Canvas IDs of one Canvas course, and `import`'s default `.gitignore` excludes
`.manifest-*.toml`. (Repos written by an older version have a single
`.canvas-manifest.toml`; `upgrade` renames it to `.manifest-canvas.toml`.)

Each manifest holds a reserved `_repo_format` entry that records the repo
format version it was written in (see [Upgrading a repo](#upgrading-a-repo-upgrade)).

```toml
# .manifest-canvas.toml — local; never commit this file

[_repo_format]
format_version = 2

["pages/syllabus.md"]
canvas_id   = 11111
canvas_type = "page"
canvas_url  = "syllabus"
last_synced = "2025-02-01T10:00:00+00:00"

["assignments/week1.md"]
canvas_id   = 98765
canvas_type = "assignment"
last_synced = "2025-02-01T10:01:00+00:00"

["modules/week-1.md"]
canvas_id        = 55555
canvas_type      = "module"
last_synced      = "2025-02-01T10:02:00+00:00"
canvas_item_ids  = {"pages/syllabus.md" = 201, "assignments/week1.md" = 202}
```

The `last_synced` field is used to skip files that haven't changed since they were last uploaded — a file is re-uploaded only when its local modification time is newer than `last_synced`. Use `--force-uploads` to bypass this check.

If the manifest is lost you can re-run the tool against a fresh Canvas course, or re-create it manually from Canvas IDs.

### Deleting a file in Canvas

The tool does **not** detect Canvas-side deletions during `update`. If you delete an item in Canvas (e.g. an image in Canvas Files) but the local file is unchanged, the next `update` run will silently skip it — the local mtime is still older than `last_synced`, so `needs_sync` returns false and no upload occurs. The manifest entry remains, pointing at a now-dead Canvas ID. Any pages that embed the deleted file will show broken links.

To fix this, run `clean-manifest --apply` and then `update` (see "Checking the manifest against the course"). That removes the dead entry, marks the pages that link to it for re-sync, and the `update` uploads the file again and re-renders those pages with its new ID.

For a single known file you can also touch it and the files that link to it, then run `update`:

```bash
touch assets/Images/path/to/file.png pages/page-that-shows-it.md
markdown-to-canvas update .
```

`--force-uploads` alone is not enough for this: for a file that is unchanged locally, the Canvas copy's `updated_at` is later than the local mtime, so the Canvas overwrite protection skips it unless `--force-overwrite` is also given.

## Upgrading a repo (`upgrade`)

The files in a course repo change format as the tool changes. To detect a repo
written for a different format, `course_settings/course_settings.toml` records
an integer `format_version` as its first key, and every manifest records the
version it was written in. A repo with no `format_version` is version 0, which
is every repo created before this feature existed.

`update`, `mv`, `publish`, `prune`, `clean-manifest`, `find-local-orphans`,
`find-canvas-orphans`, `list-titles` and `generate-due-dates` check both the repo and every
`.manifest-*.toml` in it before they read content, write a file or change
anything on Canvas. If a version differs from the tool's, the command stops and
changes nothing:

```text
Error: This course repo is format version 0 but this tool (markdown-to-canvas 0.2.1) uses format version 2. Run `markdown-to-canvas upgrade` first.
Error: course_settings/course_settings.toml is format version 3 but this tool (markdown-to-canvas 0.2.1) only understands format version 2. Update markdown-to-canvas.
```

A manifest that is older than the repo is named in the message. This happens
when another machine upgraded the repo and you pulled it, because manifests are
local and are not upgraded by the pull. `import`, `setup`, `emit-workflow`,
`install-completion` and `create-tool-aliases` do not read a course repo and do
not check.

```bash
# See what would change, without writing anything
markdown-to-canvas upgrade --noop

# Upgrade the repo you are in (or pass the path)
markdown-to-canvas upgrade [REPO]
```

`upgrade` applies each migration from the repo's version (the lowest of
`course_settings.toml` and all manifests) up to the tool's version, in order,
and prints each change. It edits `course_settings.toml` in place, so comments,
key order and layout are kept. It never contacts Canvas and runs whether or not
the git working tree is clean. Review the result with `git diff` and commit
`course_settings.toml`. If a migration cannot proceed it stops with an error and
leaves `format_version` at the last step that finished; running `upgrade` again
resumes from there.

Each run that changes `format_version` appends one entry to the `upgraded_by`
array, in the form `"<tool version> on <date>: <from> -> <to>"`. `created_by`
records the tool version that ran `import` and is never changed. None of the
three keys is sent to Canvas, and editing them does not make `update` resend
course settings.

Manifests are local, so run `upgrade` on every machine that has one. On a machine
whose `course_settings.toml` is already current, it upgrades only the manifests
and adds no `upgraded_by` entry.

Migration 0 to 1 renames a legacy `.canvas-manifest.toml` to
`.manifest-canvas.toml` (when that name is free; if both exist, it warns that
the legacy file is unused and leaves it), and records version 1 in every
manifest. `update`, `prune` and `clean-manifest` no longer rename the legacy
manifest themselves.

Migration 1 to 2 adds an empty `[relative_due_dates.tables.default]` table at
the end of `course_settings.toml` (see
[Generating due dates from offsets](#generating-due-dates-from-offsets-generate-due-dates)),
unless the file already has a `relative_due_dates` key, and records version 2 in
every manifest. It does not create a term file.

`upgrade` also checks that `tab_configuration` is a top-level key. The tool
only reads it there, so when it is nested under a section
(`[default_post_policy]`, for example) `upgrade` moves it to the top level,
before the first section header, and a notice names where it came from. A key
present in both places is an error. `upgrade --noop` reports the problem
without editing the file. Other commands never move it: a repo at the current
format version is taken to be set up correctly, so a `tab_configuration` you
nest by hand later is not applied and not repaired (run `upgrade` to move it).

### Which tool version am I running?

`uv tool list` shows the installed version of `markdown-to-canvas`. The version
comes from git tags (the build uses `hatch-vcs`), so a checkout or install from
a commit after tag `v0.2.0` reports something like `0.2.1.dev3+gabc1234`.
`created_by` and `upgraded_by` in `course_settings.toml` record the versions
that imported and upgraded the repo.

## IMSCC import

Import an existing Canvas course export (`.imscc` file) into a local Markdown repo:

```bash
markdown-to-canvas import course-export.imscc ./my-course-repo
```

This converts pages, assignments, discussions, announcements, quizzes, question banks, modules, and course settings to local files ready for use with this tool. A `canvas.toml` skeleton is written with the Canvas domain and course ID pre-filled from the export metadata.

`import` also writes an empty `[relative_due_dates.tables.default]` section at the end of `course_settings.toml` (with the shared settings commented out, and every allowed value listed) and, unless the file is already there, a fully commented-out `course_settings/term_dates.toml` that shows the [term file](#the-term-file) format. See [Generating due dates from offsets](#generating-due-dates-from-offsets-generate-due-dates).

Every top-level folder the tool recognizes (`pages/`, `assignments/`, `discussions/`, `announcements/`, `quizzes/`, `question_banks/`, `modules/`, `snippets/`, `assets/`, `course_settings/`) is created even if the course has nothing to put in it, so the repo layout always matches [How it works](#how-it-works) and there's an obvious place to add new content later. A starter `.gitignore` and `.canvasignore` are also written — both cover common OS/editor/Office junk files, plus commented-out examples of course-specific patterns (per-term-only material, feedback drafts) you can uncomment or adapt as the course grows. `.canvasignore` also actively excludes `course_definition/**` — instructor reference material (scope-and-sequence docs, curriculum outcome guides) that should never be uploaded to Canvas — and `question_banks/**`, since Canvas's API cannot create or update question banks. If the export contains any question banks, `import` prints a warning saying they cannot be re-uploaded.

**Front page.** If the export marks a page as the course home page, `import` writes `front_page = "pages/<slug>.md"` into `course_settings/course_settings.toml`. Canvas stores this on the page itself rather than in its course-settings file, so `default_view` alone does not say *which* page is the home page. Keeping the key matters for more than `update`: a home page is in no module and nothing links to it, so `front_page` is the only thing marking it as referenced — without it, `find-local-orphans` reports your landing page as unused. Imports made before 2026-09 are missing the key; if your home page went missing after an orphan cleanup, recover it from git and add the key by hand.

**Announcements** are imported into an `announcements/` folder, one Markdown file per announcement. Only the announcement itself is imported — any student replies, likes, or comments are not part of a Canvas export, so there is nothing to import. Each file gets `published: false`, which means `update` leaves it **staged (not posted)** until you set `published: true` — handy for re-posting announcements when the time is right (e.g. a midterm reminder the week before the midterm). The frontmatter keeps `title` and `published` as active fields; the original export's other metadata (post date, workflow state, etc.) is preserved as commented-out lines you can uncomment to apply (see [Announcement](#announcement-announcements)).

> **Heading levels:** Canvas already strips H1s from the content it exports, so imported headings normally keep their original levels — an H2 stays an H2. As a safety net, if a converted file *does* still contain an H1 (which Canvas would silently turn into an inaccessible styled paragraph; see the H1 warning above), the import shifts every heading in that file down one level so the H1 becomes an H2. Files without an H1 are left untouched.
>
> **Links to missing content:** When a page links to a Canvas item that isn't in the export (usually a link copied from an older course whose target was never brought over), import keeps the link text as plain text, drops the link, and prints a warning naming the file and link text. Links to graded quizzes and graded discussions, which Canvas records by their assignment ID, resolve to the imported quiz or discussion file.

> **Attribute cleanup:** Pandoc attaches curly-brace attribute blocks (e.g. `## Heading {#id .class style="..."}`) to headings, links, images, spans, and fenced divs during HTML→Markdown conversion. Import strips these down to just `id` (kept in case a table of contents links to it) and `style` (kept as user-authored formatting) — classes and other Canvas-internal attributes are dropped. If nothing is left, the `{...}` is removed entirely, and an emptied fenced div (`:::`) is unwrapped rather than left as an empty wrapper.
>
> **Nested span collapsing:** Pandoc writes an HTML `<span>`/`<div>` as `[content]{#id .class}`, and Canvas wraps exported content in several of these. Once the attribute cleanup above drops the meaningless `{.class}` blocks, what is left is a run of bare nested brackets that carry no formatting at all:
>
> ```text
> [[[[[[[[[text]]]]]]]{#module_sequence_footer_container}]]
> ```
>
> Import collapses each run to only the pairs that still mean something — a link, a reference, or a surviving attribute block — so the example above becomes `[text]{#module_sequence_footer_container}`.
>
> This is not just tidiness. Pandoc parses nested bracketed spans by backtracking exponentially, at roughly 3x per level: three levels take 0.07s, seven take 4.9s, and nine take *minutes* on a file of a few hundred bytes — every time anything converts that file. A course imported before this pass existed can still contain such runs; `find-local-orphans` will name the file and tell you to check for nested `[]`s.
>
> Only *contiguous* runs of two or more `[` are collapsed. A lone `[text]` and ordinary prose like `the value at position [0]` are left alone, as are escaped brackets (`\[`), fenced code blocks, and inline code spans — `a[i][j]` is real content in a programming course. Pandoc escapes author-typed literal brackets when it writes Markdown, so an *unescaped* run is always its own span markup, never something the author wrote.

### Verifying the import

After importing, run the coverage checker to spot-check that content from the IMSCC made it into the Markdown repo.  This script is **not** part of the automated test suite — run it manually after an import:

```bash
python scripts/check_imscc_coverage.py course-export.imscc ./my-course-repo
```

Options:

| Flag                | Default                                            | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--min-words N`     | 10                                                 | Minimum fragment length; increase to reduce coincidental matches |
| `--seed N`          | 42                                                 | Random seed — change to sample different fragments               |
| `--categories LIST` | `announcement,assignment,discussion,page,syllabus` | Comma-separated types to check                                   |

Example output:

## Listing content titles (`list-titles`)

The `list-titles` subcommand prints every assignment, discussion, and quiz in
the repo along with its due date (if any) and file path. Items are sorted by
due date (earliest first); items without a due date are listed last,
alphabetically by title.

```bash
markdown-to-canvas list-titles path/to/course-repo
```

Example output:

```text
Week 1 Problem Set  2025-02-01 23:59  assignments/week1.md
Introduce Yourself  2025-02-01 23:59  discussions/week1-intro.md
Midterm Quiz        2025-03-01 23:59  quizzes/midterm/midterm.md
A Quiz                                quizzes/a-quiz/a-quiz.md
```

This is useful when setting up the centralized `due_dates` table in
`course_settings.toml` — you can see all available titles at a glance.
Due dates shown reflect centralized overrides when present.

---

## Generating due dates from offsets (`generate-due-dates`)

A course usually has the same schedule every term: "Problem Set 1 is due four
class days after the term starts, and locks a week later". `generate-due-dates`
lets you write that schedule once, as offsets, and turns it into the absolute
dates of the [`due_dates`](#centralized-due-dates) table at the start of each
term. After that `due_dates` is yours: edit any date by hand and run `update` as
usual. The command changes only your local `course_settings.toml`; it never
contacts Canvas.

```bash
# Show what would change, without writing anything
markdown-to-canvas generate-due-dates course_settings/term_dates.toml --noop

# Compute the dates, show the changes, and ask before writing them
markdown-to-canvas generate-due-dates course_settings/term_dates.toml [REPO]

# Then send them to Canvas as usual
markdown-to-canvas update
```

It works from two inputs: a **term file** that holds what changes each term
(dates, holidays, time zone), and a **relative table** in `course_settings.toml`
that holds the schedule. The term file is a required argument, so a new term
needs a new term file and no edit to the schedule.

### The term file

A TOML file; the path is whatever you pass on the command line. `import` writes
a fully commented-out example, `course_settings/term_dates.toml`, if there is not
one already. Remove the leading `# ` from the lines you want and fill in your
values:

```toml
first_day = 2026-09-30
last_day = 2026-12-18
time_zone = "America/Los_Angeles"    # an IANA name, so daylight-saving time is handled
default_due_time = "23:59"
relative_table = "quarter11"         # optional: which table to use (see below)
noninstructional_days = [
  { title = "Veterans Day", date = 2026-11-11 },
  { title = "Thanksgiving", date = 2026-11-26 },
]
```

All keys except `relative_table` and `noninstructional_days` are required, and a
misspelled key is an error.

### The `[relative_due_dates]` section

All the settings live in one section of `course_settings.toml`, so they stay out
of the top-level keys. `import` writes an empty one, and `upgrade` adds one to
older repos.

```toml
[relative_due_dates]
# Shared by every table below (a table may set its own to override):
days_of_week = ["Mon", "Wed"]              # Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun, in any order

```

Each item has:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The title of an assignment, discussion or quiz, matched the way `due_dates` entries are. |
| `type` | Optional: `assignment`, `discussion` or `quiz`. Needed only when two items share a title. |
| `relative_to` | Where counting starts: `{ type = "START_OF_QUARTER" }` (the term's `first_day`), `{ type = "FIRST_CLASS_OF_QUARTER" }` (the first class day on or after it), `{ type = "NO_DUE_DATE" }` (the item gets `due_at = "NONE"`), or `{ type = "ASSIGNMENT", assignment_name = "Other item" }` (the other item's due *date*; the time of day starts again at `default_due_time`). An item can be relative only to another item of the same table that has a due date. |
| `offsets` | A list of offsets applied in order (below). May be empty. |
| `unlock_offset`, `lock_offset` | Optional. How far from the item's own due date it unlocks or locks. |

Tables are named, and one run uses one of them: the one named by `--table`, else
by `relative_table` in the term file, else the only one. If there are several
and none is chosen, the command lists their names and stops. That is how one
repo can carry both an 11-week and an 8-week schedule. The `ignore` list quiets
the warnings below for titles that belong to another table.

### Offsets

| Offset | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"+7 CALENDAR_DAY"`, `"-2 CALENDAR_DAY"` | Move that many calendar days. |
| `"+1 CLASS_DAY"`, `"-1 CLASS_DAY"` | Move to the next or previous day in `days_of_week`, skipping the term file's `noninstructional_days` unless `class_on_noninstructional_days` is true. Counting from a day that is not a class day lands on the first class day. |
| `"Fri NEAREST_CALENDAR_DAY"` | Move to the closest date, earlier or later, that is a Friday (any weekday abbreviation). A date already on a Friday does not move. |
| `"17:00 ABS_TIME"` | Set the time of day; the date stays. |

Every item starts at `default_due_time` on its starting date, so
`["+3 CALENDAR_DAY"]` alone means "three days later at 23:59". The time stays the
same clock time all term: 23:59 remains 23:59 on both sides of a daylight-saving
change, and each date gets the UTC offset in force on that day.

**Lock and unlock dates.** `unlock_offset` and `lock_offset` use the same
offsets, counted from the item's own due date (so `"-7 CALENDAR_DAY"` unlocks a
week before it is due). Each may be one string or a list, for example
`["+7 CALENDAR_DAY", "08:00 ABS_TIME"]`. The value `"NONE"` clears the date;
"unlock everything at the start of the quarter" is `unlock_relative_default =
"NONE"`. An item with no `unlock_offset` or `lock_offset` of its own uses the
table's `unlock_relative_default` / `lock_relative_default`, then the shared
ones; with none at all, the entry gets `"KEEP"` (leave the Canvas value alone).
An item with no due date that has an offset rule for lock or unlock gets `"KEEP"`
and a warning.

### Running it

`generate-due-dates` calculates every date first and shows what would change,
in yellow for real changes:

```text
Repo:      /home/me/cs142
Relative table: quarter11
  changed: Week 1 Problem Set: due_at: 2026-01-01T00:00:00-08:00 -> 2026-10-05T23:59:00-07:00, lock_at: KEEP -> 2026-10-12T23:59:00-07:00
  added:   Week 1 Discussion (discussion): unlock_at=NONE, due_at=2026-10-07T23:59:00-07:00, lock_at=2026-10-14T23:59:00-07:00
  unchanged: 41 entries
Write these dates into due_dates? [y/N]:
```

Nothing is written until you answer yes. With `--noop` it shows the changes and
stops. Without a terminal (a script) it refuses unless you pass `--yes`, which
skips the question but still prints the changes. If nothing would change it says
so and does not ask.

For each item of the table, an existing `due_dates` entry with the same `name`
(and `type`, when both give one) gets its `due_at`, `unlock_at` and `lock_at`
replaced; other keys of the entry, such as `only_if`, are kept. An item with no
entry gets a new one. Entries the table has no item for are left alone, and
comments and formatting elsewhere in the file are kept. The command always
computes every item and never looks at course flags: `update` applies `only_if`
afterwards, as it does for hand-written entries. Because a run overwrites the
three dates of every item in the table, hand edits made since the last run show
up in the changes as `old -> new`; run it once at the start of a term rather
than after you start editing.

It prints warnings, each naming the table or tables responsible:

* An item that matches no assignment, discussion or quiz (in the relative
  table, and in `due_dates` too if it has an entry there).
* An assignment, discussion or quiz that is in neither the relative table nor
  `due_dates`, or that has a `due_dates` entry but no item in the table.
* A notice listing `due_dates` entries the table did not produce (for example
  left from another table), which stay as they are.

Titles in the table's `ignore` list are not reported. A problem in the settings,
such as an unknown key, an unreadable offset, an item relative to a missing
item, or a circular chain, stops the run with an error naming it before anything
is written.

The arithmetic is a port of the calculation in MikesGradingTool, with these
differences. Counting across a daylight-saving change
keeps the clock time (the grading tool's dates drift by an hour there). `-N
CLASS_DAY` goes to the previous class day even with three or more class days a
week. An item relative to an item with no due date is an error. To bring an
existing grading-tool course over, `scripts/harvest_relative_due_dates.py
CONFIG.json COURSE` prints its schedule as a `[relative_due_dates]` section to
paste into `course_settings.toml`, and `... CONFIG.json --term [COURSE]` prints
the matching term file (first and last day, time zone, default due time and
holidays) to save as `course_settings/term_dates.toml`. The script needs only
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (it declares its one dependency inline), so
you can copy it anywhere on your `PATH`, run `chmod +x` on it, and run it by
name.

One `due_dates` array is shared by every section of a repo that drives several
Canvas courses, so a run produces one set of dates. Sections that need different
term lengths need separate repos, or hand-edited entries.

## Resolving external-tool labels (`create-tool-aliases`)

Canvas does not export the names of external tools that are used only in course
navigation, so after `import` the `tab_configuration` in
`course_settings/course_settings.toml` has empty `label = ""` placeholders for
those tools. The `create-tool-aliases` subcommand fills in these labels by
reading the navigation tabs from a live Canvas course.

### Workflow

1. Import the `.imscc` file into an empty Canvas course (via the Canvas UI:
   Settings → Import Course Content).
2. Run `create-tool-aliases`, passing any URL from that course:

   ```bash
   markdown-to-canvas create-tool-aliases https://school.instructure.com/courses/12345
   ```

   Any URL containing `/courses/<id>` works — you can paste whatever page you
   happen to have open (e.g. `.../courses/12345/rubrics`).

3. The subcommand prints a complete `tab_configuration` block to stdout with
   tool labels filled in:

   ```toml
   tab_configuration = [
       { id = "home" },
       { id = "modules" },
       { id = "assignments" },
       { label = "Zoom", id = "context_external_tool_gd9568f5b0d2a343486654adb2ae69aac" },
       { label = "Panopto Recordings", id = "context_external_tool_g67e4019c6ea3ce88e6856319395ed4e4" },
       { id = "grades" },
       { id = "people" },
   ]
   ```

4. Compare this output with the `tab_configuration` in your working course's
   `course_settings/course_settings.toml` and fill in (or replace) the labels.

The API token is read from the `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` environment variable. The
base URL is extracted from the course URL, so no `canvas.toml` is needed for
this subcommand.

> **Note:** The tool order in the output should match the order in the imported
> course's navigation sidebar. If the order differs from your working course's
> `tab_configuration`, rearrange the entries manually — sync matches tabs by
> label, not by position or id.
