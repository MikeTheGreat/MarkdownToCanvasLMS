# User-added info:
## Be aware that the user may accidentally give you prompts meant for other projects
The user is working on several different projects that all relate to Canavs LMS and/or teaching,
and will sometimes mistakenly prompt you for something that's really about one of the other projects.
If you think the user is doing any of the following please stop an confirm with the user before doing any work:
* User asks you to do work on something that's in a different project / directory
* User asks you about a feature that doesn't exist in this project

## Check for existing features before building a new one

This tool has more features than the user can keep in his head, so a request for
a "new" feature may already be covered by something that exists. Before starting
any feature work, read through the existing feature set (README.md, the CLI
options in `src/markdown_to_canvas/cli.py`, ARCHITECTURE.md) and tell the user
about any existing command, option, or mechanism that could do the job or get
part of the way there. Then let him decide whether to use it or build the new
thing.

"Feature work" includes writing a plan or design for a feature, not just writing
code. Look beyond the command he names: a similar capability in a *different*
subcommand counts (e.g. `prune` already deletes things from Canvas, so a request
to add deletion to `find-canvas-orphans` should surface `prune` first). Report
what you found and wait for his answer before writing the plan or the code —
a mention at the end of finished work is too late.

## Errors caused by input files: diagnose before fixing

When the user reports an error, first check whether the problem is in the user's input files (e.g., wrong relative paths in their course repo) rather than a bug in this tool's code. If the root cause is in the input files, stop and tell the user before making any code changes.

## Credit yourself as the author
When the user asks you to create a git commit message please list your 
contribution as "Authored-By" instead of "Co-Authored-By". Please list
the user as "Prompted-By", but do not include the user's email (just their name)

## Never commit to git
Even if the user asks you to create a git commit message do NOT commit to git.
Only if the user specifically asks you to commit should you do so; even then you should resume NOT committing to git for all future prompts.

## TODO.md is for future work only

TODO.md is only for possible future work items. Once a feature is implemented, document it in ARCHITECTURE.md (internal notes) and README.md (user documentation), then remove it from TODO.md. Do not leave completed items in TODO.md marked as "DONE".

## Keep the core subcommands in sync

The three most important subcommands are **update**, **import**, **mv** and **publish**. When making changes to any one of them, ensure the same change is reflected in the other two where applicable.

## Changing how existing repo files are read: bump the format version

A course repo records its file format as `format_version` in
`course_settings/course_settings.toml`, and every manifest records its own in
`_repo_format`. The tool's current version is `repo_format.FORMAT_VERSION`.
Any change that makes the tool read an existing repo file (`course_settings/`
files, content frontmatter, module or quiz files, manifests) differently, or
that makes an older tool misread a file the new tool writes, is a breaking
change: increase `repo_format.FORMAT_VERSION` by one and add a migration for
the old version to `repo_format.MIGRATIONS`, with tests. Additive changes that
older files already satisfy (for example a new optional key) do not need a
bump. Nothing enforces this mechanically.

## When asked to update documentation, you should normally consider three main files
- README.md is for notes that humans using the tool will read
- ARCHTECTURE.md is for notes, mostly for yourself, about the internals of the tool work
- TODO.md is a list of possible future features.  After changing the code "updating the docs" should include checking to see if anything in TODO.md should be removed or updated.

## User often uses a shell alias of 'gg' which expands to markdown-to-canvas


# MarkdownToCanvasLMS

A tool for managing Canvas LMS course content through Markdown files stored in a Git repository. The workflow converts Markdown (and supporting assets) into HTML fragments and uploads them to a Canvas LMS instance via the Canvas API.

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — full system behaviour, file formats, CLI options, sync algorithm, import subcommand, configuration reference
- **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** — testing strategy, layers, fixtures, and what to assert on
- **[TODO.md](TODO.md)** — planned and possible future features
- **[RUBRIC_ISSUES.md](RUBRIC_ISSUES.md)** — measured Canvas rubric behaviour (soft-deletion, copy-on-edit forking, association rules) and the open rubric issues. Read this before changing anything rubric-related; it exists so the live-Canvas experiments don't have to be repeated

## Key Design Decisions

- **Source of truth**: Git repo containing `.md` files and supporting assets (images, etc.)
- **Conversion**: Pandoc for Markdown → HTML conversion (produces clean HTML fragments suitable for Canvas)
- **Delivery**: Command-line tool, packaged as a `uv` tool for easy installation and running via `uvx`
- **Canvas content types**: Pages, Assignments, Discussion Forums, Quizzes (Classic), Modules
- **Snippet staleness**: Editing a snippet file does not trigger re-sync of files that include it (staleness is per-file mtime only). Use `--force-uploads` to propagate snippet changes.

## Canvas API Notes

- Use the [`canvasapi`](https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi) Python library rather than raw HTTP calls
- `canvasapi` wraps the Canvas REST API with Python objects (`course.get_pages()`, `course.create_assignment()`, etc.)
- Canvas REST API docs (for reference): `<base_url>/doc/api/live`
- Content types and their `canvasapi` entry points:
  - Pages: `course.get_page()` / `course.create_page()`
  - Assignments: `course.get_assignment()` / `course.create_assignment()`
  - Discussion Topics: `course.get_discussion_topic()` / `course.create_discussion_topic()`
  - Modules: `course.get_module()` / `course.create_module()`
  - Module items: `module.get_module_items()` / `module.create_module_item()` / `module_item.delete()`
- HTML body field name varies by content type (`body`, `description`, `message`) — check `canvasapi` docs per object type
- Module item `type` values: `Page`, `Assignment`, `Discussion`, `Quiz`, `File`, `ExternalUrl`, `SubHeader`
- Sync content (pages/assignments/discussions/quizzes) before syncing modules — modules reference content by Canvas ID
- Quizzes: `course.get_quiz()` / `course.create_quiz()` / `quiz.edit()` / `quiz.get_questions()` / `quiz.create_question()` / `quiz_question.delete()`

## Pandoc Notes

- Invoke as a subprocess or via `pypandoc`
- Use `--from markdown+smart` for smart punctuation
- Output `--to html5` for clean fragments
- Avoid `--standalone` so Canvas gets only the body fragment, not a full HTML document
- Math support: `pandoc --mathml` if course content includes equations
  - CanvasLMS will remove any JS so we must use static content that is screen-reader accessible
