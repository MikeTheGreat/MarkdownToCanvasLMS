# Possible Future Features

## Course flags: follow-on features beyond the shipped v1

Course flags themselves, `published_if` (frontmatter), and due_dates
`only_if` are all implemented (see README "Course flags — conditional
content" and its `published_if`/`only_if` subsections; ARCHITECTURE "Course
flags (conditional content)" and its `published_if` (frontmatter) and
due_dates `only_if` follow-up section). These extensions are sketched in
**[DESIGN-course-flags.md](DESIGN-course-flags.md) §12** and remain future
work:

- **Whole-resource exclusion via delete/prune** — go further than
  `published_if`'s unpublish semantics and actually remove a
  page/assignment/quiz from Canvas (via the prune machinery) when a flag is
  off, rather than leaving it synced-but-unpublished.
- **CLI flag overrides** — repeatable `--flag name=true/false` on
  `update`/`publish` to preview the other variant without editing the TOML
  (with care around what gets written to `flags_used`). Partly covered now:
  a `[course_flags]` table in a `canvas.toml` overrides `course_settings.toml`
  for runs using that config (see README "Several Canvas courses from one
  repo"), which handles per-section values but still needs a file rather than
  a one-off command-line switch.
- **Richer conditions and values** — `and`/`or`/parentheses, non-boolean flag
  values with `#if flag == "value"`, `$flag$` substitution; needs a real
  expression parser, keep out until a concrete need appears.
- **`list-flags` report** — each flag, its value, and the files referencing it
  (the unused-flag scan already computes the data).

A full "process `#if` everywhere in YAML/TOML" design (flags moved to their
own config file; directives allowed in frontmatter and config) was considered
and deliberately rejected in favor of the shipped `published_if`/`only_if`
structured-key approach — see ARCHITECTURE.md's `published_if`/`only_if`
section for why (call-site sprawl, per-variant YAML breakage, invalid-YAML
directive syntax). Revisit only if a case appears that genuinely needs
conditional *text* in frontmatter, not just conditional booleans/entries.

## Show due dates in the published MkDocs site

The `publish` subcommand generates a static MkDocs site but does not currently
display due dates for assignments, discussions, or quizzes. If it did, it would
need to read the centralized `due_dates` table from
`course_settings/course_settings.toml` and apply the same override logic that
`update` uses (centralized dates take precedence over per-file frontmatter).

## `read_only` and `reusable` flags are ignored by Canvas on rubric create

Verified 2026-08 against a live course: `create_rubric` with `read_only = true`
and `reusable = true` returns a rubric with **both** set to `false`, and the
follow-up PUT does not override them either. This is not (as previously
recorded here) specific to re-creating a deleted rubric — a first-time create is
affected the same way, so the earlier "restore matched by title" theory was
wrong; Canvas never restores a soft-deleted rubric, it makes a new one.

Canvas appears to derive `read_only` itself from the rubric's association count
(a rubric attached to many assignments reads back `read_only: true`, a
freshly-created one `false`), which would make the flag not settable via the API
at all. Worth confirming before spending more effort on it, since these two
fields are accepted by `rubrics.toml` and silently do nothing.

## Implement the dropped course settings as real settings

`import` writes these five keys into `course_settings.toml`, but nothing uploads
them — they are in neither `_COURSE_METADATA_KEYS` nor `_COURSE_METADATA_SKIP`.
They are currently written commented out (`_IMPORT_ONLY_NOT_UPLOADED` in
`imscc_import.py`) so at least the file is honest about it. They should be wired
up for real:

| Key | Where it belongs |
| --- | --- |
| `indexed` | `PUT /courses/:id` — fits the existing `course.update()` path; add to `_COURSE_METADATA_KEYS` |
| `allow_student_organized_groups` | `PUT /courses/:id/settings` (`course.update_settings()`) |
| `show_total_grade_as_points` | `PUT /courses/:id/settings` |
| `filter_speed_grader_by_student_group` | `PUT /courses/:id/settings` |
| `default_wiki_editing_roles` | Not found in either endpoint; may be legacy/unsettable — verify first |

The endpoint split above is from the Canvas API docs and has **not** been
verified against a live course. Only `indexed` is a one-line allowlist addition;
the other three need a new `course.update_settings()` call in
`update_course_metadata()` (or alongside it), with its own set of keys. Once a
key is genuinely uploaded, remove it from `_IMPORT_ONLY_NOT_UPLOADED` so it stops
being written as a comment.

Same question applies to the rest of `_IMPORT_ONLY_NOT_UPLOADED`
(`storage_quota` and the feature flags `conditional_release`, `content_library`,
`homeroom_course`, `horizon_course`, `career_learning_library_only`): they are
skipped because nobody implemented them, not because Canvas is known to refuse
them.

## Group sets and group assignments

Currently we don't manage this, but it would be nice

## all commands must use die() for user-facing errors — no tracebacks, no raw exceptions

## Import coverage gaps (found via pool sampling)

Running `check_imscc_coverage.py` with pool sampling against the `it-cs142` course
revealed real content that doesn't survive the `import` command. Reproduce with:

```sh
python scripts/check_imscc_coverage.py \
    it-cs142-imscc-unzipped Test_Import \
    --pool-samples 100 --seed 7 --categories ""
```

### Quiz/rubric body text not surfaced as Markdown

Rubric criterion text and quiz question bodies live in QTI XML and quiz rubric XML
but are not currently imported as any `.md` file. Examples found missing:

- `'Is the code clearly written, consistently and readably formatted, and'`
- `'Good 1.0 _7898 One or more categories of style are'`
- `'The assignment specified that you should use methods to finish'`
- `'is reasonably formatted blank Emerging 15.0 _1517 A few results'`
- `'Processing File I/O: Processing Complex Files 2024_Winter_Question_1_Example_Solution public class Answer'`

These come from quiz question prompts and assignment rubrics embedded in the IMSCC.
The rubric importer is not yet implemented; the quiz importer converts questions but
question body HTML isn't always round-tripping cleanly through Pandoc for all types.

### Page/assignment prose that was silently dropped

Plain prose from pages and assignments that should have been converted but is absent
from `Test_Import`. These point to either pages that were skipped entirely or content
inside HTML that the importer's `_extract_html_body` or Pandoc step lost:

- `'for that one other class. How To Find Due Dates'`
- `'Exam II Study Guide Exam II will be in-class. Please'`
- `'at the top (which lists your name, class, assignment number,'`
- `"image below) Once you've found the repo you can confirm"`
- `'find the Privacy & Security tab . Click on it'`
- `"don't fill this out then then instructor will assume that"`
- `"I'd rather receive thoughtful constructive criticism than answers engineered to"`
- `'Reference vs. value semantics Exam IV Study Guide Exam IV'`
- `'a merge conflict . For example, if you change the'`

To investigate: grep for a fragment in `it-cs142-imscc-unzipped` to find the source
file, then check whether the corresponding output file exists in `Test_Import` and
whether the text is present there.

## Unimplemented upload paths from `course_settings/`

These files are produced by the importer but have no upload path yet:

- **`course_settings/events.md`** — Calendar events. Requires parsing `## Title` / `**Date:**` sections back into structured event data and calling `canvas.create_calendar_event()` per event. Complex (deduplication, update-vs-create). See the course-settings upload table in ARCHITECTURE.md.
- **`course_settings/files_meta.toml`** — File visibility (`locked`, `hidden`, `display_name`, `unlock_at`) and folder visibility. Requires Canvas file IDs from the manifest (needs matching by `local_path` or `display_name`). Import-side fix also needed: `_write_files_meta_toml()` should write `local_path` alongside each file entry. See the course-settings upload table in ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Round-trip fidelity gaps (import → sync)

### `pattern_match_question` only uploads the first pattern

`quiz.py:180` uses `patterns[0]` when building the answer list for
`pattern_match_question`, so only the first entry in `answers:` is ever sent to
Canvas. If multiple accepted patterns are listed, the rest are silently dropped.
Decide whether to fix this (iterate over all patterns) or document it as intentional.

### `fill_in_blank_question` and `pattern_match_question` both become `short_answer_question`

Both types are converted to Canvas `short_answer_question` in `quiz.py`. The
distinctions (`pattern_match_question` uses substring matching; Canvas also has
`fill_in_multiple_blanks_question`) are lost on upload. This is documented in the
README. Confirm this is the intended mapping or add separate handling.

## Question banks cannot be uploaded to Canvas

`update` currently validates `question_banks/` and then warns and skips the upload
(nothing goes to Canvas, nothing is recorded in the manifest).

**Why (investigated 2026-06):** there is no supported API to create, update or delete
a question bank.

- **canvasapi (3.6.0) has no question-bank support at all.** `course.create_question_bank()`
  and `bank.create_assessment_question()` are not methods on the library's `Course`
  object (verified: `hasattr(Course, "create_question_bank")` → `False`). The old
  upload path called them and crashed with `AttributeError` on a real course
  (2026-09, IT-CS 142); its unit tests had passed only because the course was a
  `MagicMock`.
- **The documented Canvas REST API for Assessment Question Banks is read-only.**
  `/doc/api/assessment_question_banks.html` documents exactly three endpoints, all GET:
  `GET /api/v1/question_banks`, `GET /api/v1/question_banks/:id`, and
  `GET /api/v1/question_banks/:id/questions`. There is **no public POST/PUT/DELETE**
  for banks, nor for the assessment questions inside them. (Confirmed on two official
  mirrors.)
- **GraphQL does not cover them either** — Canvas's GraphQL API exposes no
  assessment-question-bank create/update/delete mutations.
- **The only write path is undocumented UI controller routes** —
  `POST/PUT/DELETE /courses/:id/question_banks...` (and `.../questions`), which the Canvas
  web UI uses. These are unstable across Canvas releases and frequently require
  session/CSRF auth rather than a bearer token, so they may simply reject the API token
  on a given instance.

**Fix options, in order of preference:**

1. Verify whether the undocumented UI routes accept bearer-token auth on the target
   Canvas instance (a small read-only probe first, e.g. `GET /courses/:id/question_banks`).
   If they do, implement delete-then-recreate via raw `course._requester.request(...)`
   calls (same pattern already used for `update_late_policy` / `update_post_policy`),
   looking up the prior bank via the manifest `canvas_id`.
2. Otherwise leave it as is.

If upload is implemented, also make the staleness check cover the `questions/*.md`
files' own mtimes (cf. `_quiz_needs_sync`); `_sync_question_banks` currently checks
only the `.toml` and referenced snippets. Import's default `.canvasignore` would
also need to stop excluding `question_banks/**`.

## Re-sync is not idempotent for rubrics

### Editing a rubric used by 2+ assignments silently does nothing

See **[RUBRIC_ISSUES.md](RUBRIC_ISSUES.md)** for the full measured Canvas behaviour
behind this and the other open rubric items.

Canvas refuses to edit a rubric in place once it has more than one *grading*
association: `PUT courses/:id/rubrics/:rubric_id` instead creates a **new** rubric
titled `X (1)`, associated with nothing, and leaves the original rubric's criteria
unchanged. The assignments keep showing the old rubric. `sync_rubrics` still
reports `Updated rubric: …`, so the edit looks like it worked.

Verified 2026-08 against a live course, including that passing
`rubric_association_id` on the PUT does not avoid the fork. Using
`purpose: "bookmark"` for the course-level association (already done) fixes the
one-assignment case, which is what produced long runs of orphan `X (1) … X (11)`
rubrics; 2+ assignments still fork.

Fix would be to detect the fork (the POST/PUT response carries a different rubric
id than the one requested), then re-point every association from the old rubric to
the new one and delete the old — `_repair_rubric_associations` in `sync.py` already
does the re-pointing half for re-created rubrics. Until then, `Updated rubric:`
should probably warn when the returned id differs from the one sent.

Note orphan `X (n)` rubrics cannot be deleted through the API as-is: with no
association, both `GET` and `DELETE courses/:id/rubrics/:id` fail (404 / 500).
Associating one with any assignment first makes the DELETE work — worth a small
cleanup subcommand if these keep accumulating.

## Grading-standard drift on Canvas is not detected when the repo is up to date

`sync_grading_standards()` verifies a title-matched standard against
`[[grading_standards]]`'s `data` before reusing it, and on any difference
changes nothing, reports every difference, and repeats the error on every
`update` until the .toml and Canvas agree (see ARCHITECTURE.md's
`[[grading_standards]]` bullet). That guarantee is *"a mismatch, once detected,
never goes quiet"* — **not** *"drift on Canvas is always detected."*

The gap: the check only runs when the `grading_standards` section is stale,
which means (a) `course_settings.toml`'s mtime is newer than `last_synced`,
(b) `--force-uploads`, or (c) a previous run found a mismatch and left the
entry unsynced. On a fully up-to-date repo, `settings_stale` is False at
`sync_course_settings()`'s mtime gate and the whole settings block returns
early, so none of the grading code is reached. So this sequence slips through:

> sync succeeds → schemes agree → section marked synced → someone edits the
> scheme **in Canvas** (or swaps the account-level scheme the course reuses) →
> the next `update` sees an unchanged .toml, skips the settings block, and
> never notices that the course now grades differently from what the repo says.

**Suggested fix**, mirroring the rubric soft-delete pre-check that already
solves the same class of problem (`live_rubric_ids` / `missing_on_canvas` in
`sync_course_settings()`, which deliberately runs *before* the staleness gate
because the hash cache would otherwise pin the broken state in place):

- Before the `if not settings_stale and not rubrics_stale ...` early return,
  when `settings.get("grading_standards")` is non-empty, call
  `capi._visible_grading_standards(course)` and re-run `_scheme_differences()`
  for each declared standard that matches a live one by title.
- On any difference, force `"grading_standards"` into `stale_sections` (or
  report directly and append to `section_failures`) so the existing
  mismatch path prints the error and leaves the entry unsynced.
- Guard it so it is skipped when the course has no `[[grading_standards]]`, and
  make a failed lookup non-fatal — the account walk already tolerates accounts
  the token cannot read.

**Cost:** one or two extra API calls on *every* `update`, including no-op runs
(`GET courses/:id/grading_standards` plus one `GET accounts/:id/grading_standards`
per account in the chain). That is the tradeoff — the current design does zero
grading-standard calls when nothing changed.

**Why it might still be worth it:** the failure mode is a silent change to every
student's letter grade. A real instance of exactly this was found on
2026-09-02 — a course was pointed at a course-local clone whose cutoffs were
100× too small (a 4.0 started at 0.98%), left behind by the bug fixed in
b70ca28, and nothing surfaced it until the standards were audited by hand.

Deferred by the user on 2026-09-02 after being offered; recorded here so the
limitation is written down rather than rediscovered.

## Quiz BFS traversal (`-t` with quizzes)

`_get_file_refs()` returns an empty set for `quizzes/` files, so `-t` on a module that includes a quiz will not follow links embedded in quiz description or question HTML. The quiz itself is synced (including link rewriting), but BFS won't pre-upload unreferenced assets or pages that only appear inside quiz content.

The fix would be to parse the quiz `.md` + question files for local `<a>`/`<img>` refs in `_get_file_refs()` and return them so BFS can follow them. This is lower priority since `rewrite_links()` already handles stub-creation for missing manifest entries at upload time.

## Orphan detection: transitive reachability

`find-local-orphans` and `find-canvas-orphans` are both non-transitive: a
resource counts as referenced if *anything* links to it, even a referrer that
is itself an orphan. So an image linked only from an unreferenced page is not
reported, and finding it takes a second run after the page is dealt with.

A reachability version would instead walk out from the roots — the modules,
`front_page`, the syllabus, and any published-by-other-means entry point — and
report everything not reached. That is strictly more useful and strictly more
dangerous: it depends on having the root set exactly right, and getting it
wrong reports live content as dead.

Deferred by the user on 2026-09-10 when the non-transitive version was
specified, explicitly to be revisited later.

Design notes if picked up: `local_orphans.collect_local_refs()` already returns
the outbound edges for every source type, so the graph is in hand — what is
missing is the root set and a BFS over it. `publish.collect_reachable()` already
does exactly this walk for the static-site build and is the obvious thing to
reuse or generalize.

## `find-canvas-orphans` never reports unreferenced Canvas files

`orphans.py` collects Canvas **files** as reference *targets*
(`ResourceKey("file", id)`, from `/courses/<id>/files/<id>` links) but never
enumerates them as candidates — `find_orphans()` fetches pages, assignments,
discussions and quizzes, and no files at all. So a file uploaded to the course
that nothing links to is invisible to the report.

Fixing it means adding a `course.get_files()` pass to build file candidates.
Worth checking first how noisy that is: Canvas auto-creates files for things
like profile pictures and submission attachments, which would need filtering
out before the report is usable.

Note `find-local-orphans` does cover the repo-side equivalent (unreferenced
files under `assets/`), so this gap only affects files that reached Canvas some
other way.

## `--rebuild-manifest`: re-sync manifest from Canvas

If the manifest file is lost, corrupted, or drifts out of sync with Canvas, a `--rebuild-manifest` flag would walk the live Canvas course and reconstruct the manifest from what actually exists there.

How it would work:

- Query Canvas for all pages, assignments, discussions, files, and modules in the course
- For each item, match it back to a local file by title or URL slug
- Write the Canvas IDs into a fresh manifest
- Report any Canvas items that could not be matched to a local file (orphans), and any local files that have no corresponding Canvas item

This is a recovery/diagnostic tool, not part of the normal sync flow.

`clean-manifest` already covers the common repair case (entries whose Canvas ID is not in the configured course are removed, and the next `update` re-creates them). A rebuild would still be needed to recover a lost manifest without creating duplicates in Canvas.

## `download` subcommand: download Canvas course to local Markdown structure

A `download` subcommand would do the reverse of the main sync: pull content from an existing Canvas course and write it out as a local Markdown repo, suitable for then being managed by this tool.

How it would work:

- Fetch all pages, assignments, discussions, modules, and files from Canvas
- Convert HTML body content back to Markdown (e.g. via `pandoc --from html --to markdown`)
- Write each item as a `.md` file in the appropriate local directory (`pages/`, `assignments/`, etc.), with Canvas metadata written as YAML frontmatter
- Download files to `assets/`, preserving Canvas folder structure
- Write module definitions as module `.md` files with links to the downloaded content files
- Populate the manifest with the Canvas IDs of all downloaded items

Useful for bootstrapping a repo from a course that was originally built directly in Canvas, or for creating a local backup.

## End-to-end tests against a live Canvas sandbox

An optional smoke-test suite that runs the full tool against a real Canvas sandbox course and then queries Canvas via the API to verify that content landed correctly (HTML body, published state, module item order, etc.).

This is intentionally not part of the main test suite — it requires Canvas credentials, a dedicated sandbox course, and state cleanup between runs. It is slow and inherently network-dependent.

When implemented, the suggested approach:

- Maintain a dedicated Canvas sandbox course used only for testing
- Before each run, delete all pages/assignments/discussions/modules in the sandbox to get a clean slate
- Run the tool against `tests/fixtures/` pointed at the sandbox
- Use `canvasapi` directly in the test assertions to fetch each uploaded item and verify its content, metadata, and published state
- Run this suite manually or in a separate CI job gated on `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` being present — not on every push

## Angle-bracket URL syntax not handled in some Markdown parsers

Markdown allows `[text](<url>)` to wrap a URL in angle brackets (typically used
for filenames that contain spaces). This is handled in `mv.py` (link rewriting)
and `publish.py:extract_local_refs` (reachability traversal), but three other
places that parse raw Markdown link syntax do not strip the brackets and would
silently fail if a link used this syntax:

- **`convert.py:_SNIPPET_LINK_RE`** — block snippet expansion: `[text](<snippets/foo.md>)` would not be recognized as a snippet ref
- **`sync.py:_MODULE_LINK_RE`** — module item parsing: `- [Title](<../pages/foo.md>)` would fail to resolve the content file
- **`quiz.py:_QUIZ_LINK_RE`** — quiz question list: `1. [Q1](<questions/q1.md>)` would fail to find the question file

These are considered negligible risk in practice because those link syntaxes are
controlled/structured formats that users don't write by hand with angle brackets,
but they could theoretically be triggered by an editor that auto-inserts `<>` for
paths with spaces.

Fix pattern: `mv.py:_MD_LINK_RE` and `publish.py:_MD_LINK_RE` +
`_link_destination` show how to match the destination (anchor on `](`, allow
quoted titles and balanced parens), strip `<>` and the title, and `unquote`
percent-encoding such as `%20`.

## Filesystem watcher for automatic move/rename tracking

A background daemon (using Python's `watchdog` library) that monitors the course
repo for file moves/renames and automatically runs the same logic as the `mv`
subcommand — updating the manifest, rewriting cross-references, and updating
`module_order.toml`.

The `mv` subcommand's core logic (in `mv.py`) is designed to be called
programmatically, so the watcher would be a thin event-detection layer on top.

Caveats to address:

- Dropbox sync generates spurious file events (creates/deletes/moves) that must
  be distinguished from user-initiated operations
- Some editors implement rename as create-new + delete-old rather than atomic
  rename, so the watcher would need heuristic correlation
- Must be running at the time of the move — missed events are silent failures
- Cross-filesystem moves decompose into copy+delete with no way to correlate

## In course_settings.toml, within due_dates, KEEP and CREATE_NONE_THEN_KEEP do the same thing

Maybe remove KEEP?

## Announcements: possible follow-ups

Announcements are fully supported end to end — import, `update` (create as
`is_announcement=true`, unpublished unless `published: true`, with optional
settings like `delayed_post_at`/`locked`/`discussion_type` forwarded), `prune`,
and `mv` (see ARCHITECTURE.md → import/update). Remaining nice-to-have:

- Optionally surface announcements on the `publish` MkDocs site (today they are
  intentionally excluded, since they are not module content).

## Publish command: include a schedule

- it would be nice to include a schedule, sorted chronologically
- maybe on the syllabus page, like in Canvas?
  - Rename to Syllabus + Schedule

## Pin the emitted `publish.yml` to a release tag instead of `HEAD`

`emit_workflow()` in `publish.py` writes a GitHub Actions workflow whose install
step is `pip install "markdown-to-canvas[publish] @ git+https://github.com/MikeTheGreat/MarkdownToCanvasLMS"`
— with **no ref**. So every course repo's CI tracks this repo's `HEAD`, and any
breaking change here (a rename, a CLI flag removal) silently breaks every course
site's next deploy. This is exactly what bit the 2026-08-01 rename: the course
repo's build failed at the `pip install` step because the distribution metadata
name no longer matched what the workflow asked for.

Pinning to a release tag (`@v0.2.0`) would fix it, but that needs a release
process — tagging, and a decision about how course repos get told to bump. Both
of which don't exist yet.

Effort: small for the pin itself; the release process is the real work.

## Optional: block *all* outbound HTTP in tests, not just `requests.put`

`tests/conftest.py` patches only `requests.put` (the one raw-requests call in
`canvas_api._set_module_item_published`). All other network calls go through the
mocked `canvasapi`. A socket-level guard (e.g., an autouse fixture that raises on
`socket.connect` to non-local addresses) would make "a test forgot to mock" fail
loudly instead of hitting a real Canvas.

Effort: ~30 min. Risk: none in principle; skip if it fights with pypandoc.

## Centralized alt-text (`alt_text.toml`) — DECIDED AGAINST (see note)

> **Decision (2026-07-02):** The user chose **not** to build this. Instead they
> will use **Ally's built-in AI Alt Text Assistant** (admin-enabled) to populate
> file-level image descriptions. Kept here only so the design work and the Ally
> research aren't lost. **Do not start implementing without re-confirming with the
> user first.**

### The original goal

Canvas/Ally nags for alt text in two independent places, backed by two different
stores:

1. **Alt on the `<img>` embed** (inside a page/assignment/discussion RCE) — written
   into that item's HTML and stored in Canvas. **The tool already handles this**
   via `convert.mark_decorative_images` and the `<img alt="...">` it emits.
2. **Alt on the standalone image *file*** (Canvas Files tool / Ally checker) — this
   is what the user was being nagged about and wanted to automate.

### Why file-level alt CANNOT be set programmatically (the blocker)

- **The Canvas Files API has no alt/description field.** `PUT /api/v1/files/:id`
  (what `canvasapi`'s `File.update()` calls) accepts only `name`,
  `parent_folder_id`, `lock_at`, `unlock_at`, `locked`, `hidden`,
  `visibility_level`. There is nothing on the Canvas file object to write alt text to.
- **Ally stores Files-tool descriptions in Ally's own system, not Canvas.** Per
  Anthology's docs: *"Ally will store the description so that your students can
  access it when they encounter the image in your course. However, when a
  description is added from the Files tool, it will not be stored by Canvas."*
- **No public instructor-facing Ally write API.** The only Ally API is the
  admin-level, read-oriented reporting/REST integration — it cannot push per-file
  descriptions. So there is no back door either.

### The design that was worked out (if ever revisited)

A separate `course_settings/alt_text.toml` (kept as its own file, not a table in
`course_settings.toml`, because the list can get verbose) holding an array of
`[[files]]` entries, each with a repo-root-relative `path` and an `alt_text`
string:

```toml
[[files]]
path = "assets/homeworks/a1-banner.png"
alt_text = 'Banner for Assignment 1, with the text "Ask your instructor if you''d like help!"'
```

Three ways a Markdown image reference would resolve:

1. **Decorative** — `![](path.png)` → `alt=""` + `role="presentation"` (already the
   current behavior via `mark_decorative_images`).
2. **Centralized default** — `![USE_ALT_TEXT_TOML](path.png)` → look the image up in
   `alt_text.toml` and substitute its `alt_text`.
3. **Inline override** — `![Some specific description](path.png)` → use the inline
   text verbatim (per-use text wins; correct because the same image often needs
   different alt in different contexts).

Key implementation decisions that were settled:

- **Key on repo-root-relative paths, not `../`-relative.** A Markdown image path is
  relative to *its* `.md` file, so the same shared image referenced from two files
  has two different raw strings. Canonicalize both sides the way
  `link_rewrite._to_local_key` already does
  (`(source_file.parent / href).resolve().relative_to(course_root)`) before matching.
- **Resolve the sentinel as Markdown preprocessing, before Pandoc** — i.e. rewrite
  `![USE_ALT_TEXT_TOML](path)` into `![<looked-up text>](path)` in the same spirit
  as `convert.preprocess_snippets`, so link rewriting and decorative marking
  downstream work unchanged.
- **A missing lookup is a HARD ERROR** (user confirmed). If a file uses
  `USE_ALT_TEXT_TOML` but there is no matching `alt_text.toml` entry — or the
  `alt_text.toml` file itself is absent — fail loudly (like the snippet loader on a
  missing snippet). A silent fallback to `alt=""` would ship inaccessible content
  images while hiding the mistake.
- **Companion `list`/`print` subcommand** — print all alt strings sorted by file
  path, as a paste-ready crib sheet for the manual Ally Files-tool entry (the only
  part that can't be automated). This was the realistic ceiling on automation
  before the user opted for Ally's AI assistant instead.

# Bugs to Fix

- in the 2026 Spring import of IT-CS 142, moved the assets/Syllabus and blah blah folder to just be assets/Syllabus, and it seemed to work fine (updated 1 file).  However, changing the assets/Canvas Starter Files (Loose Files) to just be assets/Canvas Starter Files did NOT fix links to any of the 21 files in it.

- Within a module Markdown file: 'published' is connected to whether the underlying item is published (for example, an assignment) - maybe remove the <!-- published:false --> mechanism from modules & rely on the underlying content instead?

- Even though I'm not changing anything in Canvas I sometimes still see an error about 'newer item on Canvas', like so:
The following resources were NOT uploaded because Canvas has a newer version.
Review these files and re-upload manually if needed (use --force-overwrite to skip this check):
  assignments/worksheets/01-a-unit-worksheets.md
  assignments/worksheets/01-b-unit-worksheets.md

# Possible future improvements

(Got these from Fable, probably won't do them, but didn't want to lose them)
Do **not** "improve" these without an explicit user request:

1. **`imscc_import._build_frontmatter`** (hand-rolled YAML emitter with a quoting
   heuristic, `:2456`). Swapping to `yaml.safe_dump` would change output formatting
   across every imported repo and break the many tests that assert exact
   frontmatter strings. It is ugly and it is fine.
2. **`_simplify_pandoc_attrs`** (`imscc_import.py:581`) — subtle fence-pairing
   logic, recently worked on (commit 8ff4183), well-tested. Leave it.
3. **Manifest flush-on-every-record** (`manifest.py:62-79`) — looks wasteful, is a
   deliberate crash-safety property (interrupted-sync resume depends on it;
   TESTING.md asserts it).
4. **Regex-based HTML rewriting** in `link_rewrite.py` / `convert.py` — "parse HTML
   with regex" is normally a smell, but the input is Pandoc-generated (predictable)
   HTML; swapping in an HTML parser is a rewrite with new failure modes and no
   user-visible gain.
5. **`canvas_api._set_module_item_published`'s raw `requests.put`** — works around
   a real canvasapi/Canvas bug (missing `module_id` on returned items; File-item
   500s). `tests/conftest.py`'s HTTP blocker targets exactly this call.
6. **mv.py case-only-rename path computation** (`_compute_case_rename_dest_rel`,
   `validate_move`'s dest_rel gymnastics) — convoluted but battle-tested against
   case-insensitive-filesystem edge cases; tidy only the dead bits (H3), don't
   restructure.
7. **`fill_in_blank`/`pattern_match` → `short_answer_question` mapping and
   `patterns[0]`-only upload** (`quiz.py:174-196`) — known, documented in README
   and TODO.md; behavior decision belongs to the user.
8. **Broad `except Exception: pass` in prune/find-canvas-orphans support paths**
   (`sync.py:596, 702, 990, 998`; `orphans.py:136, 158, 170`) — intentional
   degrade-gracefully behavior for optional data. Converting to logging would be
   fine but is cosmetic; don't convert to raises.
9. **`_sync_quiz`'s `config_course_id: int = 0` default** — odd, but every real
   caller passes it; goes away naturally with P1.
