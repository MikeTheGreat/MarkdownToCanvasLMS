"""Ignore-file support: skip uploading files matched by .canvasignore.

Patterns use git's wildmatch syntax (via the `pathspec` library), so an
optional `.canvasignore` at the repo root governs what is excluded from
Canvas. `.gitignore` is deliberately *not* consulted: this lets a repo
exclude per-term materials from git while still uploading them to Canvas.
Content that should be excluded from both git and Canvas must be listed in
both files.

Matching is purely additive: with no `.canvasignore` present, nothing is
matched and every file is processed exactly as before.
